Eighteen healthy, trained subjects in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design received H2-rich calcium powder (HCP) (1500 mg/day, containing 2.544 µg/day of H2) or H2-depleted placebo (1500 mg/day) for three consecutive days. They performed cycling incremental exercise starting at 20-watt work rate, increasing by 20 watts/2 min until exhaustion. Breath-by-breath pulmonary ventilation (V˙E) and CO2 output (V˙CO2) were measured and muscle deoxygenation (deoxy[Hb + Mb]) was determined via time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy in the vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF). Blood gases' pH, lactate, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentrations were measured at rest and 120-, 200-, and 240-watt work rates. At rest, the HCP group had significantly lower V˙E, V˙CO2, and higher HCO3-, partial pressures of CO2 (PCO2) versus placebo. During exercise, a significant pH decrease and greater HCO3- continued until 240-watt workload in HCP. The V˙E was significantly lower in HCP versus placebo, but HCP did not affect the gas exchange status of V˙CO2 or oxygen uptake (V˙O2). HCP increased absolute values of deoxy[Hb + Mb] at the RF but not VL. Thus, HCP-induced hypoventilation would lead to lower pH and secondarily impaired balance between O2 delivery and utilization in the local RF during exercise, suggesting that HCP supplementation, which increases the at-rest antioxidant potential, affects the lower ventilation and pH status during incremental exercise. HPC induced a significantly lower O2 delivery/utilization ratio in the RF but not the VL, which may be because these regions possess inherently different vascular/metabolic control properties, perhaps related to fiber-type composition.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2021-Positive outcomes of hydrogen rich water (HRW) supplementation on endurance performance have been shown, but the effects of HRW in resistance training are unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 1,260 ml of HRW intake on physiological, perceptual, and performance responses to a resistance training and after 24 hours of recovery. This randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled cross-over study included 12 men aged 23.8 ± 1.9 years. Subjects performed a half squat, knee flexion, and extension exercises with the load set at 70% of 1 repetition maximum for 3 sets (10 reps/set). Lunges were performed with a load of 30% of body mass for 3 sets (20 reps/set). Time of each set, lactate, and ratings of perceived exertion were assessed mid-way through exercise and immediately after the exercise. Creatine kinase, muscle soreness visual analog scale ratings, countermovement jump, and heart rate variability were evaluated before the training and at 30 minutes, 6, and 24 hours of recovery. Lunges were performed faster with HRW compared with placebo (p < 0.001). Hydrogen rich water reduced lactate at mid-way and immediately after the exercise (HRW: 5.3 ± 2.1 and 5.1 ± 2.2, placebo: 6.5 ± 1.8 and 6.3 ± 2.2 mmol·L-1, p ≤ 0.008). Visual analog scale ratings were significantly lower with HRW (26 ± 11 vs. 41 ± 20 mm, p = 0.002) after 24 hours of recovery.

Microglia play a vital role in protecting the brain from neuronal damage, which is closely related to inflammatory responses. The Nrf2 signaling pathway has an impact on microglial and neuronal injury. Here, we mainly explored the molecular mechanism by which H2 regulates neuroinflammation in SAE and the role of Nrf2 in this process. Methods: An in vivo model of SAE was generated by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Primary microglia and neurons were cultured to establish an in vitro model. Microglia, neurons and brain tissue were obtained to detect Nrf2 expression, inflammation, cell injury, apoptosis, and microglial polarization. Escape latency, the number of platform crossings and the time spent in the target quadrant were measured to assess cognitive function. Results: H2 attenuated microglial polarization from the M1 to the M2 phenotype, cytokine release and TLR/NF-κb activation and protected neurons from LPS-activated microglia-induced injury via the Nrf2 pathway. SAE activated Nrf2 expression, and H2 further improved Nrf2 expression in SAE mice. H2 alleviated microglial polarization from the M1 to the M2 phenotype and cytokine release in the cerebral cortex and improved neuronal injury or cognitive dysfunction in SAE mice and wild-type mice but not in Nrf2-/- mice. Conclusion: H2 exerts antineuroinflammatory effects associated with TLR4/NF-κB signaling activation and neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines, neuronal loss and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo through the Nrf2 pathway.

Since there is no upper limit for the safe concentration of hydrogen, this study tested the effects of high-flow (not high concentration) hydrogen inhalation on immune function. From October 2019 to January 2020, 20 adult participants (31-60 years old) were enrolled in a self-controlled study to check the immune function in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets before and after a 2-week hydrogen inhalation protocol. The participants inhaled hydrogen for 2 or 4 hours each day. After 2 weeks of hydrogen inhalation, statistically significant changes were observed in follicular helper T cells, helper and cytotoxic T cells, natural killer and natural killer T cells, and gamma delta T cells, generally suggesting a decrease in their proportions. These results show that high-flow hydrogen inhalation has an inhibitory effect on the immune function of healthy participants.

When the tourniquet is released, reperfusion injury occurs with the resumption of blood flow. Molecular hydrogen can easily attach to biomembranes and enter cytosol, mitochondria and other organelles of the cell and convert the formed OH- to H₂O to prevent cell and tissue damage. Aim: We investigated the effects of hydrogen rich saline solution (HRSS) on penile Mathieu type flap tissue with Pt application in rats. Study design: Thirty-six Wistar-albino male rats were randomly divided into six groups. No operations were performed in the Sham group. Ventral penile Mathieu type flap was prepared and Pt was applied to the root of the penis with a plastic band in other groups. Pt was applied 10 and 30 min in the PT1⁰ and PT³⁰ groups. HRSS was injected intraperitoneally (ip) 5 ml/kg just before Pt was released in the HRSS1⁰ and HRSS³⁰ groups. In the HRSSB group, HRSS was injected 1 h before 10 min of Pt application. At the 4th hour of experiments the rats were sacrificed and tissue samples were taken for biochemical and histopathological studies. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were determined in the penile tissue. The results were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Pearson's Chi-Squared test. Results: Tissue MDA, MPO, IL-6 and TNF-α values were significantly lower in all HRSS groups compared to PT1⁰ and PT³⁰ groups. Tissue GSH levels of HRSS groups were higher compared to PT groups. Histopathologically, inflammation was found to be higher in PT groups compared to HRSS groups. Interestingly, in the HRSSB group with HRSS administration prior to Pt, the damage was less in grade, but not statistically different than the other HRSS groups (p > 0.05). Discussion: In previous studies, damage in histopathological examinations after Pt could only be demonstrated long after tourniquet applications such as 24 h and with longer duration of Pt such as 30 min. Structural changes in different Pt application times could be demonstrated at 60 min by electron microscopy and 48 h by light microscopy. In this study, the histopathological effect of Pt application could be demonstrated at the 4th hour after release and HRSS was observed to reduce the damage histopathologically as well as biochemically with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It was observed that administration of HRSS either before or following Pt did not cause an alteration statistically.

Thus, a novel technology is needed to further mitigate IMRT-induced bone marrow damage. Molecular hydrogen (H2) was recently reported as a preventive and therapeutic antioxidant that selectively scavenges hydroxyl radical (·OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-). This observational study aimed to examine whether H2 gas treatment improves IMRT-induced bone marrow damage in cancer patients. The study was performed at Clinic C4 in Tokyo, Japan between May 2015 and November 2016. During this period, all enrolled patients received IMRT once per day for 1 to 4 weeks. After each time of IMRT, the patients of control group (n = 7, 3 men and 4 women, age range: 26-70 years) received mild hyperbaric oxygen therapy in health care chamber for 30 minutes, and the patients of H2 group (n = 16, 8 men and 8 women, age range: 35-82 years) received 5% H2 gas in health care chamber for 30 minutes once per day. Radiation-induced bone marrow damage was evaluated by hematological examination of peripheral blood obtained before and after IMRT, and the data were expressed by the ratio after to before treatment. The total number of radiation times and total exposure doses of radiation were similar between the control and H2 groups. IMRT with health care chamber therapy significantly reduced white blood cells and platelets, but not red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit. In contrast, H2 gas treatment significantly alleviates the reducing effects of white blood cells and platelets (P = 0.0011 and P = 0.0275, respectively). Tumor responses to IMRT were similar between the two groups. The results obtained demonstrated that H2 gas inhalation therapy alleviated IMRT-induced bone marrow damage without compromising the anti-tumor effects of IMRT. The present study suggests that this novel approach of H2 gas inhalation therapy may be applicable to IMRT-induced bone marrow damage in cancer patients. The study protocol was approved by an Ethics Committee Review of Tokyo Clinic and Research Institute ICVS Incorporated (Tokyo, Japan) on February 1, 2019, and was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN ID: UMIN000035864) on February 20, 2019.

Meanwhile, ROS also serve as signaling mediators to upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression via activation of the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway, and the increased pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger respiratory burst of inflammatory cells that further accelerates ROS production in the inflamed tissue. Such crosstalk between ROS and inflammatory responses leads to a chain reaction of negativity, and cause progression of several chronic pathologies. Since molecular hydrogen is known to preferentially remove cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrites, and to prevent cell and tissue damage, we here examined whether electrolyzed hydrogen water (EHW) enriched with molecular hydrogen and reactive hydrogen storing platinum nanoparticles dissolved from an electrode could alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation induced by continuous stress challenges. Five-day continuous stress loading to rats elevated reactive oxygen metabolites-derived compounds (d-ROMs), interleukin (IL)-1β, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels and decreased the biological antioxidant potential (BAP) level. Drinking EHW during 5-day continuous stress loading significantly alleviated all of these changes. The results suggest that EHW could suppress stress-response-associated oxidative stress and IL-1β level elevation in vivo, and that drinking of EHW is effective for controlling stress responses via its antioxidant potential.

Cell viability was repressed by 'Asc6Palm + PVP-Pt' mixture more markedly than by Asc6Palm or PVP-Pt alone, together with cell shrinkage and fragmentation, in contrast to no additive carcinostatic effect of 'Asc + PVP-Pt' or 'Asc2Phos + PVP-Pt'. The effects might be partly due to efficiency for intracellular uptake of PVP-Pt, as previously shown by our studies that Pt atoms composed of PVP-Pt were incorporated into human tongue carcinoma cells by 9.6-fold compared to normal human tongue epitheliocytes. Asc6Palm was advantageous for intracellular uptake, in terms of the proper balance for molecular hydrophilicity-lipophilicity (BMHL), whereas 6-O-stearoyl (C18) Asc or 2,6-O-dipalmitoyl (2 × C16) was demonstrated to be less carcinostatic owing to a lower BMHL. Although esterolytically converted from Asc6Palm, Asc was necessitated to be retained for efficient carcinostasis, and demonstrated by HPLC-coulometric ECD analysis to be appreciably stabilized in electrolytically generated hydrogen (dissolved hydrogen: 0.575 mg/L)-water, but scarcely in hydrogen-gas-bubbled water (0.427 mg/L), Mg stick-derived hydrogen (0.044 mg/L) water, or tap water, suggesting that hydrogen-rich water suppresses oxidative decomposition of Asc.

In this study, heat-retention effects of hydrogen-rich water bath were assessed by thermographic clinical trials, which employed twenty-four healthy subjects. The thermograms indicated that, under the same conditions (41 °C, 10-min bathing), hydrogen-rich water bath (hydrogen concentrations: 185-548 μg/L; oxidation-reduction potentials: -167 to -91 mV, versus 0.8 μg/L and +479 mV for normal bath, respectively) brought about the heat-retention being more marked than those of normal water bath for several body-parts in the order as follows: abdomen > upper legs > arms > hands > feet, for 30- and 60-min post-bathing, being in contrast to scarce heat-retention for head, armpits and lower legs. Then, as reflection to promotive effects on blood stream, we also examined the thickness of fingertip-capillary in hands. The thickness was expanded in the hydrogen-rich water bath more markedly than that in the normal water bath, suggesting that the hydrogen-rich water bath may have the hydrogen-based promotive effect, exceeding over mere heat retention-based effects, on blood circulation of the whole body. Meanwhile, the heat-retention in hydrogen-rich water bath weakly or moderately correlated with contents of the subcutaneous fat, whole body fat and body mass index, and inversely correlated with skeletal muscle rates, although their correlation degrees did not obviously exceed over normal water bath, with a poor relation with the basal metabolism rate. Thus, the hydrogen-rich water bath was suggested to exert heat-retention effects exceeding over normal water bath, in diverse body-parts such as abdomen, upper legs, arms and hands, via promotion to blood flow which was reflected by expanding the thickness of capillary. The heat-retention after bathing can be noted as effects of the hydrogen-rich water bath, which is applicable for most of people widespread regardless of their body composition index.

Some key points in the pathogenesis of AP remain unclear, such as early activation of pancreatic enzymes. Several recent reports have shown the protective effect of hydrogen on several AP animal models, and the mechanism is related to antioxidant activity. Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) is known to accompany pancreatic enzymes synthesis and secretion pathway of in pancreatic acinar cells, while role of hsp60 in AP remains a topic. Aim of this study was to investigate effect of hydrogen pretreatment on AP and the mechanisms, focusing on pancreatic oxidative stress and Hsp60 expression. Methods: 80 mice were randomly assigned into four groups: HAP group, AP group, HNS group, and NS group and each group were set 3 observation time point as 1 h, 3 h and 5 h (n = 6-8). Mouse AP model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg/kg caerulein per hour for 6 injections both in AP and HAP groups, and mice in NS group and HNS group given normal saline (NS) injections at the same way as control respectively. Mice in HAP group and HNS group were treated with hydrogen-rich gases inhalation for 3 days before the first injection of caerulein or saline, while mice in AP group and NS group in normal air condition. Histopathology of pancreatic tissue, plasma amylase and lipase, plasma IL-1 and IL-6, pancreatic glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and Hsp60 mRNA and protein expression were investigated. Comparisons were made by one-way analysis of variance. Results: The pancreatic pathological changes, plasma amylase and lipase activity, and the increase of plasma IL-1 and IL-6 levels in AP mice were significantly improved by the hydrogen-rich gases pretreatment, Meanwhile, the pancreatic GSH content increased and the pancreatic MDA content decreased. And, the hydrogen-rich gases pretreatment improved the Hsp60 protein expression in pancreatic tissues of AP mice at 1 h and 5 h. Conclusions: Pre-inhalation of hydrogen-rich gases have a good protective effect on AP mice, and the possible mechanisms of reduced oxidative stress and the early increased pancreatic Hsp60 protein deserve attention.

Recent evidence indicated that hydrogen could reduce the levels of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, but its role in morphine tolerance has not been studied. The rats were intrathecally administered with morphine (10 µg/10 µl each time, twice/day for 5 days). Hydrogen enriched saline (HS) or saline was given intraperitoneally at 1, 3 and 10 ml/kg for 10 min before each dose of morphine administration. The tail-flick latency, mechanical threshold and thermal latency were assessed one day (baseline) before and daily for up to 5 days during morphine injection. The pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6)] (by western blotting), astrocyte activation (by immunofluorescence and western blotting), and nitration of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and glutamine synthetase (GS) (by immunoprecipitation), membrane and total expression of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor NR1 and NR2B subunits were carried out in the spinal dorsal horns. Chronic morphine administration induced antinociceptive tolerance, and together led to increased TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 expression, astrocyte activation, GLT-1 and GS nitration, increased membrane and total NR1, NR2B expression. Injection of HS attenuated morphine tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression, inhibited astrocyte activation, decreased GLT-1 and GS nitration, and inhibited membrane trafficking of NMDA receptor. Our result showed that hydrogen pretreatment prevented morphine tolerance by reducing neuroinflammation, GLT-1, GS nitration, NMDA receptor trafficking in the spinal dorsal horn. Pretreatment with hydrogen might be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for the prevention of morphine tolerance.

The purpose of our experiment was to investigate the protective effect of drinking water with high concentration of hydrogen in our study named hydrogen rich water (HRW) on mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to elucidate the mechanism underlying the molecular hydrogen therapeutic action. The choline-supplemented, L-amino acid-defined (CSAA) or choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet for 20 weeks were used to induce NASH and fibrosis in the mice model and simultaneously treated with HRW for different periods of time. Primary hepatocytes were stimulated by palmitate in order to mimic a liver lipid metabolism during fatty liver formation. Mice in the CSAA + HRW group had lower serum levels of ALT and AST and milder histological damage. The inflammatory cytokines were expressed at lower levels in the HRW group than in the CSAA group. Importantly, HRW reversed hepatocyte apoptosis as well as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in pre-existing hepatic fibrosis specimens. Molecular hydrogen inhibits the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of inflammation cytokines through an HO-1/IL-10-independent pathway. Furthermore, HRW improved hepatic steatosis in the CSAA + HRW group. Sirt1 induction by molecular hydrogen via the HO-1/AMPK/PPARα/PPARγ pathway suppresses palmitate-mediated abnormal fat metabolism. Orally administered HRW suppressed steatosis induced by CSAA and attenuated fibrosis induced by CDAA, possibly by reducing oxidative stress and the inflammation response.

Our previous studies have reported that molecular hydrogen (H2) can be used to prevent and treat various diseases. But the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of hydrogen-rich water on gut microbiota in CINP. Methods: All C57BL/6J mice were divided into 4 groups: The group fed with normal drinking water and injected with saline (H2O + Saline), the group fed with normal drinking water and injected with oxaliplatin (H2O + OXA), the group fed with hydrogen-rich water and injected with saline (HW + Saline), and the group fed with hydrogen-rich water and injected with oxaliplatin (HW + OXA). The mechanical paw withdrawal threshold of the mice was tested on days 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 after hydrogen-rich water treatment. On day 20, feces of mice from different groups were collected for microbial community diversity and structure analysis. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), oxidative stress factors (OH- and ONOO-), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were detected in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), L4-6 spinal cord segments and serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of TLR4 in DRG and spinal cords was determined by Western blot. Results: The results illustrated that hydrogen-rich water could alleviate oxaliplatin-induced hyperalgesia, reduce the microbial diversity and alter the structure of gut microbiota, reverse the imbalance of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, and decrease the expression of LPS and TLR4. Conclusion: Hydrogen-rich water may alleviate CINP by affecting the diversity and structure of the gut microbiota, and then the LPS-TLR4 pathway, which provides a direction for further research.

Pathogenesis of OA is closely related to numerous inflammatory and apoptosis cytokines. Hydrogen (H2) reportedly exhibits a diversity of effects such as anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties via the JNK pathway. However, it is unknown whether H2 has a protective effect against OA via the JNK signaling pathway. Therefore, the aim of this study was to figure out whether hydrogen has protective effect on chondrocyte and further explore the possible underlying mechanism. Methods: The chondrocytes were obtained from the human cartilage tissues. Cells were stimulated by TBHP and treated with hydrogen. In vitro treatment effects were evaluated by Western blot assay, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and TUNEL method. We conducted mice model of destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) and treated with hydrogen. In vivo treatment effects were evaluated by X-ray imaging assay, safranin O (SO) staining, TUNEL staining and immunohistochemical assay. Results: Our results showed that hydrogen can inhibit inflammatory factors (ADAMTS5 and MMP13) and apoptosis factors (cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome c, and Bax) in TBHP-induced chondrocytes. Furthermore, hydrogen can suppress the activation of JNK signaling pathway, whereas the effect of hydrogen can be abolished by anisomycin (a JNK activator). In vivo results showed that hydrogen can down-regulate the expression of p-JNK and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Conclusion: We uncovered that hydrogen (H2) could alleviate apoptosis response and ECM degradation in human chondrocytes via inhibiting the activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Meanwhile, in the surgically-induced DMM mice model, treatment with hydrogen (H2) performed a significant role in OA progression.

Here, the cardiovascular protective effects of the intake of molecular hydrogen water (MHW) were investigated using high-fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. MHW was prepared using supplier sticks and degassed water as control. MHW intake for 2 weeks did not improve blood sugar or body weight but decreased heart weight in DIO mice. Moreover, MHW intake improved cardiac hypertrophy, shortened the width of cardiomyocytes, dilated the capillaries and arterioles, activated myocardial eNOS-Ser-1177 phosphorylation, and restored left ventricular function in DIO mice. MHW intake promoted the histological conversion of hypertrophy to hyperplasia in white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) with the upregulation of thermogenic and cardiovascular protective genes in BAT (i.e., Ucp-1, Vegf-a, and eNos). Furthermore, the results of a colony formation assay of bone-marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) indicated that MHW activated the expansion, differentiation, and mobilization of EPCs to maintain vascular homeostasis. These findings indicate that the intake of MHW exerts cardiovascular protective effects in DIO mice.

However, there are few studies of H2 therapy to treat sepsis, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of H2 are mostly unknown. We aimed to confirm effects of H2 therapy on sepsis and reveal its therapeutic mechanism via RNA sequencing in multiple organs in septic mice. Methods: Nine-week-old C57BL/6 male mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham procedure. Subsequently, the CLP model received immediate ± continuous inhalation of 7% H2. Mice were observed for a week to assess survival rates. Serum inflammatory cytokines were evaluated at 24 h after CLP procedure. Liver, intestine, and lungs in CLP mice receiving 24-h ± H2 therapy were assessed by RNA sequencing. Data were analyzed with Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (QIAGEN Inc). Results: Seven-day survival rate in septic mice was significantly improved in the H2 inhalation group compared with that in the control group (75% versus 40%, P < 0.05). H2 treatment attenuated serum interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α levels at 24 h after CLP, and blood glucose levels were maintained in the H2-treated group. In RNA sequencing, canonical pathway analysis revealed inactivity of various inflammatory signaling pathways, for example, acute phase response signaling and STAT3 pathways, in the liver and intestine in the CLP model after 24-h H2 inhalation. We detected significantly decreased expressions of upstream regulator genes such as the CD14 antigen gene in the liver and various cytokine receptor genes in the intestine and lungs in the H2-treated group. Conclusions: These findings may contribute to clarifying the mechanism of action of H2 therapy in sepsis.

Notably, reperfusion after ischemia causes ischemia/reperfusion injury (IR injury) and the 'no-reflow' phenomenon seriously affecting the therapeutic effects in clinical practice. The principle purpose of this study is to validate the effect of hydrogen gas on IHD and further explore the mechanism of hydrogen gas in alleviating myocardial I/R injury and no-reflow phenomenon. Materials and methods: The rat model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion was well established. Myocardial infarct size was evaluated by TTC & Evans blue staining. The no-reflow area and the cardiac function were assessed by thioflavin-S staining and echocardiography respectively. Microstructure and mitochondria of myocardial tissue were assessed by transmission electron microscope. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the expression of NLRP3 mediated pyroptosis related proteins. The 8-OHdG, MDA and serum total ROS were used to evaluate the degree of oxidative stress. Key findings: The myocardial infarct size, no-reflow area, cardiac function, microstructure and mitochondrial morphology of I/R model rats were significantly improved after hydrogen inhalation. In addition, the expression of 8-OHdG, MDA, ROS and NLRP3 mediated pyroptosis related proteins were significantly decreased. Significance: We found that oxidative stress and NLRP3 mediated pyroptosis are the important mechanisms for hydrogen to alleviate myocardial I/R injury, and we also confirmed that hydrogen can significantly improve no reflow phenomenon caused by ischemia-reperfusion.

The experiments were performed on 60 male white non-linear sexually mature rats weighing 0.16-0.18 kg to study the effect of water loading with saturation with molecular hydrogen. Sublimate nephropathy was modeled under conditions of a hyposodium diet by subcutaneous injection of 0.1% mercury dichloride solution at a dosage of 5 mg/kg with a study after 72 hours, which corresponded to the early polyuric stage of acute kidney injury and the development of no-reflow syndrome. To saturate the water with molecular hydrogen at a concentration of 1.2 ppm and a redox potential from -100 to -350 mV, a new generation H2 generator Blue Water 900 (Korea) was used, containing an improved proton-exchange membrane PEM/SPE. Used: pathophysiological, biochemical, functional, chemiluminescent, statistical research methods. The antioxidant effect of loading with water with saturation with molecular hydrogen leads to a decrease in the loss of sodium ions due to an improvement in its reabsorption and β2-microglobulin in the proximal tubule, a decrease in lipid peroxidation in the renal cortex was noted, the degree of its damage by an increase in the K+/Na+ ratio and a decrease in degree of edema. Improvement in the condition of the proximal nephron led to an increase in total, enzymatic fibrinolytic activity in the renal cortex. The increase in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase in the renal cortex is due to an increase in the delivery of electrons due to the negative redox potential and the selective antioxidant effect of molecular hydrogen. The anti-edema effect of molecular hydrogen was revealed at the level of 7 layers of the kidney. During the formation of the no-reflow syndrome in rats on a low-sodium diet 72 hours after the introduction of mercuric chloride, the possibility of breaking large and small vicious circles with an antioxidant solution of H2 was shown due to its high permeability and the ability to neutralize the hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite.

The cause of death is mostly sepsis-induced multiple organ failure. Oxidative stress can play an important role in this situation, but antioxidant therapy to capture any excessive reactive oxygen species has not yet been fully established. Methods: Two experiments were performed. In the first experiment, we confirmed the effects of peritoneal lavage with hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) after a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation in rats. In the second experiment, the changes in the hemodynamic state following this procedure were observed in a porcine model of abdominal sepsis to evaluate its safety and utility. Results: Peritoneal lavage with HRS significantly improved the survival after CLP in rats, and it ameliorated the levels of sepsis-induced organ failure. Moreover, it showed anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis as well as antioxidant effects. The second experiment demonstrated the potential safety and feasibility of this procedure in a large animal model. Conclusion: This procedure can improve survival after sepsis through mitigating the sepsis-induced organ failure by inhibiting oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory pathways. Peritoneal lavage with HRS may therefore be an effective, safe, and practical therapy for patients with acute peritonitis.

We have previously demonstrated that combined treatment with dissolved hydrogen molecule (H2) and platinum nanocolloid (Pt-nc) has carcinostatic effects and that increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were closely associated with carcinostatic effects in Ehrlich mouse ascites tumor cells. However, it is unknown whether combined treatment-induced ROS generation can occur in human cancer cells. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the carcinostatic effect of the combined treatment in human cells and investigate the relationship between treatment efficacy and ROS generation. H2 and Pt-nc treatment could exert cytostatic action by inhibiting the growth of human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 and human gastric adenocarcinoma-derived NUGC-4 cells; however, no effect was observed in normal human embryo fibroblast OUMS-36 cells by the temporary exposure. These findings indicate that combined treatment with H2 and Pt-nc may act selectively in tumor cells compared with normal cells. Additionally, combined treatment with H2 and Pt-nc resulted in an approximately 200-fold increase in intracellular ROS levels compared with the control, whereas the suppressive effect of tumor cell growth was abrogated entirely by catalase treatment in NUGC-4 cells. Furthermore, combined treatment with H2 and Pt-nc induced hydrogen peroxide generation, cellular morphological changes, cell death, and a decline in DNA synthesis-positive cells.

FW is generated by the electrolysis of a sodium chloride solution and accelerate the burn wound healing. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, the cytokine/chemokine secretion profile of HSC3 cells was examined using a cytokine array. FW treatment significantly induced interleukin (IL)-1α secretion, which was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Subsequently, the HSC3 cells were pre-treated with cycloheximide (CHX) for 1 h prior to FW stimulation to determine whether the augmented IL-1α secretion was due to enhanced protein synthesis. CHX pre-treatment did not affect IL-1α secretion suggesting that the secreted IL-1α might have been derived from intracellular storage sites. The amount of IL-1α in the cell lysate of the FW-treated HSC3 cells was significantly lower than that of the non-treated cells. Immunofluorescence staining using a polyclonal antibody against full-length IL-1α revealed a drastic reduction in IL-1α inside the FW- treated cells. IL-1α is synthesized in its precursor form (pIL-1α) and cleaved to produce pro-piece and mature IL-1α (ppIL-1α and mIL-1α) inside the cells. In the present study, only pIL-1α was detected within the HSC3 cells in its resting state. However, FW stimulation resulted in the release of the 33 kDa and two other smaller forms (about 19 kDa) of the protein.

This randomized controlled clinical trial evaluated intracisternal magnesium sulfate infusion combined with intravenous hydrogen therapy in patients with poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage. Methods: Thirty-seven patients with poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage were randomized to Mg+H2, Mg, and control groups. Mg and Mg+H2 groups received intracisternal magnesium sulfate infusion (2.5 mmol/L) at 20 mL/h for 14 days. Mg+H2 group also received intravenous hydrogen-rich solution infusion for 14 days. Primary outcome measures were occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia and cerebral vasospasm. Secondary outcome measures were modified Rankin Scale and Karnofsky performance status at 3 and 12 months, Barthel index at 12 months, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid malondialdehyde and neuron-specific enolase. Results: Serum neuron-specific enolase levels were significantly lower in the Mg+H2 group from days 3 to 14 than in the control group. Cerebrospinal fluid neuron-specific enolase levels were also significantly lower in the Mg+H2 group from days 3 to 7 than in the control group. Incidences of cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia were significantly higher in the control group than in other groups.

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction play key roles in PD pathophysiology. Animal studies have demonstrated that photobiomodulation (PBM) may enhance mitochondrial function and boost adenosine triphosphate production, thus alleviating PD symptoms; however, this process can cause increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is a potent and possibly therapeutic antioxidant that can mitigate the effect of ROS. PBM targeting the brainstem may facilitate neuronal activity, and the concomitant H2 may clear additional ROS produced by PBM. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the safety and effectiveness of PBM + H2 in patients with PD. Methods: We included 18 patients with PD (age 30-80 years) who were at Hoehn and Yahr stages II-III. All the participants received daily PBM + H2 therapy for 2 weeks. The adverse event and the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores were recorded. Results: We noted that the UPDRS scores began significantly decreasing from the first week, and this improvement persisted until the end of therapy. Moreover, no adverse event was recorded. After 1 week of therapy cessation, UPDRS scores slightly increased but the improvement remained significant compared with the baseline. Conclusion: This novel, proof-of-concept study demonstrated that PBM+H2 therapy is safe and reduces disease severity. A larger-scaled clinical trial is warranted to completely investigate the effects of PBM + H2 therapy on PD.

Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: sham group (Sham), ischemia-reperfusion group (IR), IR plus H2 inhalation group (IR + H2). IR was induced by interrupting hind limb blood flow for 3h, followed by 4h of reperfusion, and H2 was administered by inhalation throughout the reperfusion process.

In exploring the underlying mechanisms, we found that hydrogen could markedly mitigate the degree of IR-induced ER stress and apoptosis (P < 0.05). Additionally, hydrogen could markedly inhibit the IR injury by modulating the phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway (P < 0.05).

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of hydrogen nano-bubble water (HW) on ROS generation, adipogenesis, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated OP9 adipocytes, and three-dimensional (3D) subcutaneous adipose equivalents. Nanoparticle tracking analysis showed that fresh HW contains 1.17 × 108/mL of nano-sized hydrogen bubbles. Even after 8 to 13 months of storage, approximately half of the bubbles still remained in the water. CellROX® staining showed that HW could diminish H2O2- or PMA-induced intracellular ROS generation in human keratinocytes HaCaT and OP9 cells. We discovered that PMA could markedly increase lipid accumulation to 180% and IL-6 secretion 2.7-fold in OP9 adipocytes. Similarly, H2O2 (5 µM) also significantly stimulated lipid accumulation in OP9 cells and the 3D adipose equivalents. HW treatment significantly repressed H2O2- or PMA-induced lipid accumulation and IL-6 secretion in OP9 adipocytes and the 3D adipose equivalents. In conclusion, HW showed a possibility of repressing oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and adipogenesis at cellular/tissue levels.

The hydrogen bubbles generated locally not only function as a propellant for the motion but also function as the active ingredient for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation scavenging. Under ultrasound guidance, the micromotors are injected intra-articularly, and the dynamics of the micromotors can be visualized. By scavenging ROS and inflammation via active hydrogen, the oxidative stress is relieved and the levels of inflammation cytokines are reduced by our micromotors, showing prominent therapeutic efficacy in ameliorating joint damage and suppressing the overall arthritis severity toward a collagen-induced arthritis rat model.

Dynamic DNA methylation, which catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), is involved in the formation of synaptic plasticity and cognitive memory in the central nervous system. And brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), to be a key signaling component in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, can be induced by neuronal activity accompanied by hypomethylation of its promoter IV. This study was designed to illustrate whether H2 can mediate SAE by alter the BDNF promoter IV methylation mediated by DNMTs. We established an SAE model by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) in C57BL/6 mice. The Morris water maze test from the 4th to the 10th day after sham or CLP operations were used to evaluate mouse cognitive function. Hippocampal tissues were isolated at the 24 after sham or CLP surgery. Pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). mRNA or protein levels of DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b), BDNF promoter IV and total BDNF were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot tests. Immunofluorescence staining were used to determine the expressions of DNMT1 and DNMT3a. The quantitative methylation analysis of the 11 CpG island of the promoter region of BDNF exon IV was determined using theAgena's MassARRAY EpiTYPER system. We found that 2% H2 inhalation can reduce pro-inflammatory factors, alleviate DNMT1, DNMT3a but not DNMT3b expression, make hypomethylation of BDNF promoter IV at 5 CpG sites, enhance the BDNF levels and then decrease escape latency but increase platform crossing times in septic mice. Our results suggest that 2% H2 inhalation may alleviate SAE through altering the regulation of BDNF promoter IV methylation which mediated by DNMT1 and DNMT3a in the hippocampus of septic mice.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of molecular hydrogen on the pathogenesis of asthma. Methods: OVA sensitized asthma mouse model and house dust mite treated 16HBE cellular model were established and hydrogen/oxygen mixture was used to treat asthmatic mice and 16HBE cells. Serum and BALF cytokines were measured with specific ELISA assays. E-cadherin and ZO-1 were detected by immunohistochemical staining and expression of caspase 3 and 9, NF-κB, IL-33 and ST2 was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot and/or immunofluorescence. IL-33 promoter activity was analyzed by dual-luciferase assay. ILC2 population was assayed by flow cytometry and differentially expressed miRNAs were detected using miRNA array. Results: Serum and BALF levels of IL-33 and other alarmin and type II cytokines were greatly increased by OVA and inhibited by H2 in asthmatic mice. The expression of NF-κB (p65) and ST2 was upregulated by OVA and suppressed by H2. ILC2 population was markedly increased in OVA-induced asthmatic mice, and such increase was inhibited by H2. E-cadherin and ZO-1 levels in airway tissues of asthmatic mice were significantly lower than that of control mice, and the reduction was recovered by H2 treatment. H2 alleviated HDM induced apoptosis of 16HBE cells, upregulation of IL-33 and ST2, and elevation of IL-33 promoter activity. A group of miRNAs differentially expressed in HDM and HDM + H2 treated 16HBE cells were identified. Conclusions: These data demonstrated that H2 is efficient in suppressing allergen-induced asthma and could be developed as a therapeutics for asthma and other conditions of type II inflammation.

Oxidative stress, alterations in hepatic metabolism, immunity and inflammation have all been reported to contribute to the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Hydrogen gas (H2) serves a key role in the modulation of hepatic redox, immune and inflammatory homeostasis. However, the effects of treatment using intraperitoneal injection of H2 on ALD remain unexplored. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of intraperitoneal injection of H2 on acute alcohol-induced liver injury in a mouse model. H2 was administered by daily intraperitoneal injections (1.0 ml/100 g) for 4 days. On day 4, the mice received H2 after fasting for 5.5 h. After 30 min, the mice were administered with 33% (v/v) ethanol at a cumulative dose of 4.5 g/kg body weight by four equally divided gavages at 20-min intervals. Blood and liver tissues were collected at 16 h after the first ethanol gavage. Subsequently, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglyceride and total cholesterol (TC) levels were analyzed using an Automatic Clinical Analyzer. Hepatic JNK activity and GAPDH levels were examined by western blotting. It was observed that acute ethanol gavage induced liver injury, as indicated by significantly increased serum ALT and AST levels, which were effectively decreased by H2 at 16 h after the first ethanol gavage. In addition, H2 treatment reduced serum TC levels in the Alcohol+H2 group when compared with those in Alcohol group. Mechanistically, H2 attenuated hepatic JNK phosphorylation induced by acute ethanol gavage. Therefore, the results of the present study demonstrated that treatment with exogenous H2 by intraperitoneal injection may alleviate acute alcohol-induced liver injury by inhibiting hepatic JNK activation, which may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for ALD.

To date, little is known about the effects of hydrogen water on early stage of PD. Here, protective actions of hydrogen-saturated saline (HS) on rotenone-induced PD rats, as well as its underlying mechanisms were investigated. HS was used to treat PD rats at three general stages; early, medium and late, which were represented by rotenone induced rats for 0, 7 and 14 days. HS treatment significantly alleviated the cardiovascular and motor symptoms in rotenone-induced PD rats, improved the survival number of RVLM catecholaminergic neurons and nigral dopamine neurons only in early and medium stages of PD rats. Decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alpha-synuclein (α-Syn), transformation of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I/II and degradation of sequestosome 1 (p62) were detected, as well as increased expression level of autophagy related protein 5 (ATG5) and B-cell lymphoma-2 interacting protein 1 (Beclin-1) in the RVLM and substantia nigra (SN) after HS treatment in early and medium stages of PD rats. In addition, phosphorylation levels of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian rapamycin target protein (mTOR) decreased after HS treatment in early and medium stages of PD rats. The results suggested that HS treatment exerted beneficial effects in early and medium stages before motor impairments emerged but not in the late stage of rotenone-induced PD rats. It exerted neuroprotection with RVLM catecholaminergic neurons and nigral dopamine neurons, mediated in part by decreasing levels of ROS and α-Syn through increasing autophagy machinery which were partly via inhibiting PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway.

The well-modeled T2DM rats (induced by high-fat diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) injection) were divided into two groups (n ≥ 15 of each): fed a high-fat diet and drinking distilled water or HW at a constant concentration above 1.0 ppm; normal rats were used as control group (n ≥ 10): fed a regular diet and drinking distilled water. Several biomarkers of lipid and glucose metabolism, oxidative stress ,and inflammation were evaluated after drinking distilled water or HW for 3 weeks. The effect of HW on liver, kidney, and spleen of T2DM rats was also analyzed by HE and Oil Red O staining. The results showed that drinking HW suppressed the increase in glucose, total cholesterol, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Moreover, HW also ameliorates hyperglycemia-induced liver, kidney, and spleen dysfunction. Overall, this study indicates that patients with T2DM may be able to improve their condition by supplementing HW as daily drinking water.

As mitochondrial activators exhibit synergistic effects with nivolumab, the current study investigated whether hydrogen gas also affects the clinical outcomes of nivolumab. A total of 42 of 56 patients with lung cancer treated with nivolumab received hydrogen gas. Exhausted markers (PD-1 and Tim-3) on cell populations in the CD8+ T cell differentiation pathway were analyzed using flow cytometry. The concentration of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was measured as a marker of mitochondrial function. The 42 patients treated with hydrogen gas and nivolumab (HGN) indicated a significantly longer overall survival (OS) compared with those treated with nivolumab only (n=14). In multivariate analysis, PD-1+Tim-3+terminal CD8+ T cells (PDT+) were an independent poor prognostic factor in OS, and CoQ10 showed a tendency to be associated with improved OS. The change in the rate of PDT+ and CoQ10 after vs. before HGN (PDT+ ratio and CoQ10 ratio, respectively) revealed that patients with low PDT+ ratio (<0.81) and high CoQ10 ratio (>1.175) had significantly longer OS compared with those with high PDT+ ratio and low CoQ10 ratio. Furthermore, PDT+, with a significant reverse correlation with CoQ10, was significantly lower in patients with high CoQ10 and/or CoQ10 ratio than in those low CoQ10 and/or CoQ10.

Alkali induces oxidative stress in corneas followed by excessive corneal inflammation, neovascularization, and untransparent scar formation. Molecular hydrogen (H2), a potent reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, suppresses oxidative stress and enables corneal healing when applied on the corneal surface. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the H2 pretreatment of healthy corneas evokes a protective effect against corneal alkali-induced oxidative stress. Rabbit eyes were pretreated with a H2 solution or buffer solution, by drops onto the ocular surface, and the corneas were then burned with 0.25 M NaOH. The results obtained with immunohistochemistry and pachymetry showed that in the corneas of H2-pretreated eyes, slight oxidative stress appeared followed by an increased expression of antioxidant enzymes. When these corneas were postburned with alkali, the alkali-induced oxidative stress was suppressed. This was in contrast to postburned buffer-pretreated corneas, where the oxidative stress was strong. These corneas healed with scar formation and neovascularization, whereas corneas of H2-pretreated eyes healed with restoration of transparency in the majority of cases. Corneal neovascularization was strongly suppressed. Our results suggest that the corneal alkali-induced oxidative stress was reduced via the increased antioxidant capacity of corneal cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is further suggested that the ability of H2 to induce the increase in antioxidant cell capacity is important for eye protection against various diseases or external influences associated with ROS production.

For patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we report here on two objectives, the immunosenescence for advanced non-small cell lung cancer and hydrogen gas inhalation for immune reconstitution. From July 1st to September 25th, 2019, 20 non-small cell lung cancer patients were enrolled to evaluate the immunosenescence of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, including T cell, natural killer/natural killer T cell and gamma delta T cell. Two weeks of hydrogen inhalation was performed during the waiting period for treatment-related examination. All patients inhaled a mixture of hydrogen (66.7%) and oxygen (33.3%) with a gas flow rate of 3 L/min for 4 hours each day. None of the patients received any standard treatment during the hydrogen inhalation period. After pretreatment testing, major indexes of immunosenescence were observed. The abnormally higher indexes included exhausted cytotoxic T cells, senescent cytotoxic T cells, and killer Vδ1 cells. After 2 weeks of hydrogen therapy, the number of exhausted and senescent cytotoxic T cells decreased to within the normal range, and there was an increase in killer Vδ1 cells. The abnormally lower indexes included functional helper and cytotoxic T cells, Th1, total natural killer T cells, natural killer, and Vδ2 cells. After 2 weeks of hydrogen therapy, all six cell subsets increased to within the normal range. The current data indicate that the immunosenescence of advanced non-small cell lung cancer involves nearly all lymphocyte subsets, and 2 weeks of hydrogen treatment can significantly improve most of these indexes.

The rats and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were pre-treated with hydrogen before receiving irradiation (7Gy per fraction, five fractions in total once a day for rats, 4Gy for BMSCs). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell differentiation were measured in the BMSCs. Also, the radioprotective effect of hydrogen for ORNJ in Sprague-Dawley rats was examined by gross clinical manifestations, micro-computed tomography, and histology. Hydrogen significantly reduced the production of ROS in BMSCs after irradiation. The cell viability was significantly decreased after irradiation (P= 0.001), but pre-treatment with hydrogen before irradiation increased the cell viability (P= 0.025). Hydrogen considerably increased the cellular differentiation potential of the irradiated cells. Comparing with the rats underwent irradiaton only, those rats treated by hydrogen-rich saline significantly appeared improved occlusion, salivation, alopecia, oral ulcer, and less bone necrosis. Myofibroblasts accumulated overwhelmingly in the fibrosis medulla and around the sequestrum after irradiation, and this was decreased in the group pre-treated with hydrogen.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A rat model of OA was established using the modified Hulth method, and rats were forced to exercise for 30 min every day 1 week after surgery for 7 weeks. Mankin's method was used to score the severity of OA. The animals were assigned into the OA group, OA+HW group, and sham operation group. After 8 weeks, the animals in the OA group had a Mankin score >8 points, and HW was administered into the knee joint. After 2 weeks of treatment, articular cartilage was obtained for pathological examination, consisting of hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue, and Hoechst staining, as well as quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. This combination of pharmacological and molecular biological analyses was performed to examine the mechanism underlying the protective effect of HW on articular cartilage. RESULTS The antioxidant effects of HW suppressed oxidative damage, which may have aided the inhibition of ECM-degrading enzymes (MMP3, MMP13, ADAMT4, and ADAMT5), the upregulation of Col II and aggrecan expression, and the downregulation of COX-2, iNOS, and NO expression. The results of HE staining indicated intra-articular treatment of HW attenuated cartilage degradation. However, Hoechst staining in the OA group indicated the nuclei of the fragmented chondrocytes were condensed compared to the sham operation group, and this effect was inhibited by HW. CONCLUSIONS HW showed a protective effect against the progression of OA in an animal model, which may have been mediated by its anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activities.

The administration of neutral electrolyzed saline, a solution that contains reactive species of chlorine and oxygen (ROS), may be an effective therapeutic alternative due to its immunomodulating characteristics, in systemic inflammation control, as well as in immune response improvement, promoting control of the viral infection. The present study evaluated the efficacy of treatment with intravenous and/or nebulized neutral electrolyzed saline combined with usual medical care versus usual medical care alone, in ambulatory patients with COVID-19. Methods: A prospective, 2-arm, parallel group, randomized, open-label, phase I-II clinical trial included 39 patients in the control group (usual medical care alone) and 45 patients in the experimental group (usual medical care + intravenous and/or nebulized electrolyzed saline, with dose escalation). Two aspects were evaluated during the twenty-day follow-up: i) the number of patients with disease progression (hospitalization or death); and ii) the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS), a single-question outcome that determines patient well-being thresholds for pain and function. Biochemical and hematologic parameters, as well as adverse effects, were evaluated in the experimental group. Results: The experimental treatment decreased the risk for hospitalization by 92% (adjusted RR=0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.50, P=0.007), with a 43-fold increase in the probability of achieving an acceptable symptom state on day 5 (adjusted RR= 42.96, 95% CI: 9.22-200.0, P<0.001). Intravenous + nebulized administration was better than nebulized administration alone, but nebulized administration was better than usual medical care alone. Clinical improvement correlated with a decrease in C-reactive protein, and aberrant monocytes and an increase of lymphocytes, and platelets. Cortisol and testosterone levels were also evaluated, observing a decrease in cortisol levels and an increment of testosterone-cortisol ratio, on days 2 and 4.

There is growing evidence that molecular hydrogen counteracts oxidative and/or inflammatory responses. Therefore, we investigated the effects of molecular hydrogen-rich water (HW) on muscle performance and oxidative stress markers induced by strenuous exercise. A single-blind, crossover, randomized controlled trial has been designed. Eight male volunteers completed two 3-day consecutive exercise tests under two conditions: HW and placebo water (PW). The exercise test included a countermovement jump, maximal voluntary isometric contraction of knee extensors, and sprint cycling. The sprint cycling exercise was comprised three repetitions of 10-second maximal pedaling against a resistance of 7.5% body mass and 110-second active rest (no-load pedaling). Before and after the exercise test, participants drank the 500 mL of HW (5.14 ± 0.03 ppm in H2 concentration) or PW (0.00 ± 0.00 ppm). At 7 hours before the first exercise test (Day 1), as baseline, and 16 hours after the exercise test on each day, blood samples were obtained.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) possesses potent antioxidant activity and has been shown to protect against various oxidative stress-related diseases. In this study, we first investigated the effects and mechanisms of H2 in human melanocytes damaged by hydrogen peroxide. We initially found that H2 reduced intracellular ROS accumulation and malondialdehyde levels in both vitiligo specimens and hydrogen peroxide-treated melanocytes in vitro in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, concomitant with the enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activity. Correspondingly, H2 reversed hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis and dysfunction in both normal and vitiligo melanocytes. H2 protected mitochondrial morphology and function in melanocytes under stress and promoted the activation of Nrf2 signaling, whereas Nrf2 deficiency abolished the protective effect of H2 against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage. Furthermore, H2 positively modulated β-catenin in hydrogen peroxide-treated melanocytes, and the β-catenin pathway was implicated in H2-induced Nrf2 activation. Collectively, our results indicate that H2 could be a promising therapeutic agent for vitiligo treatment via attenuating oxidative damage, and its beneficial effect in human melanocytes might involve Wnt/β-catenin-mediated activation of Nrf2 signaling.

In the cardiac cells, mitochondria produce by way of the oxidative phosphorylation more than 90% of the energy supply in the form of ATP, which is utilized in many ATP-dependent processes, like cycling of the contractile proteins or maintaining ion gradients. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of cellular metabolism and their levels are controlled by intracellular antioxidant systems. Imbalance between ROS and the antioxidant defense leads to oxidative stress and oxidative changes to cellular biomolecules. Molecular hydrogen (H2) has been proved as beneficial in the prevention and therapy of various diseases including cardiovascular disorders. It selectively scavenges hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite, reduces oxidative stress, and has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. The effect of H2 on the myocardial mitochondrial function and coenzyme Q levels is not well known. In this paper, we demonstrated that consumption of H2-rich water (HRW) resulted in stimulated rat cardiac mitochondrial electron respiratory chain function and increased levels of ATP production by Complex I and Complex II substrates. Similarly, coenzyme Q9 levels in the rat plasma, myocardial tissue, and mitochondria were increased and malondialdehyde level in plasma was reduced after HRW administration. Based on obtained data, we hypothesize a new metabolic pathway of the H2 effect in mitochondria on the Q-cycle and in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. The Q-cycle contains three coenzyme Q forms: coenzyme Q in oxidized form (ubiquinone), radical form (semiquinone), or reduced form (ubiquinol). H2 may be a donor of both electron and proton in the Q-cycle and thus we can suppose stimulation of coenzyme Q production. When ubiquinone is reduced to ubiquinol, lipid peroxidation is reduced. Increased CoQ9 concentration can stimulate electron transport from Complex I and Complex II to Complex III and increase ATP production via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Our results indicate that H2 may function to prevent/treat disease states with disrupted myocardial mitochondrial function.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms of molecular hydrogen still remains elusive. Mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) is a known stress response to perturbed mitochondrial proteostasis caused by oxidative stress or mitochondrial dysfunction. We examined the effects of molecular hydrogen on mtUPR by examining mtUPR‐related protein expression in vivo and in vitro. Mice drinking hydrogen water showed higher expression of the HSP60 chaperone protein, which is an mtUPR marker, as well as other mtUPR‐related proteins including protein kinase R (PKR), phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a (eIf2a), and activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5). Incubation of cultured cells in 10% hydrogen gas increased expression of HSP60 and some mtUPR‐related proteins in four human cell lines (A549, HeLa, HT1080, and PC3 cells, which are called “responders” hereafter), but not in three other human cell lines (HCT116, HepG2, and SH‐SY5Y cells, which are called “non‐responders”). Flowcytometric analysis disclosed that higher mitochondrial mass, higher superoxide production, higher mitochondrial membrane potential in “responders” compared to “non‐responders’. Similarly, measurement of the oxygen consumption rate revealed high spare capacity of the electron transport complex (ETC) activity in “responders”. Indeed, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of gene expression profiles in gene expression omnibus (GEO) of two groups of cell lines demonstrated that ETC‐related pathways were upregulated in “responders”. In addition, quantification of DNA synthesis by BrdU assay revealed that incubation of cultured cells in 10% hydrogen gas for 48 h induced cell proliferation, and rescued proliferation blockage by rotenone in “responders”. We report that hydrogen induces mtUPR and cellular proliferation in cell lines with higher mitochondrial ETC activity. Molecular hydrogen ameliorates a variety of diseases including Parkinson’s disease, myocardiac or cerebral infarction, and inflammatory diseases. Molecular hydrogen is thus likely to manage mitochondrial stress through activation of mtUPR, and exerts its effects on these oxidative stress‐related diseases.

Recently, it has been suggested that molecular hydrogen (H2) augments mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, the hypothesis that inhaling H2 could facilitate lipid metabolism during aerobic exercise was investigated in the current study by measuring the breath acetone levels, which could be used as non-invasive indicators of lipid metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the effect of inhaling H2 on breath acetone output during submaximal exercise using a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, and cross-over experimental design. After taking a 20-minute baseline measurement, breath acetone levels were measured in ten male subjects who performed a 60% peak oxygen uptake-intensity cycling exercise for 20 minutes while inhaling either 1% H2 or a control gas. In another experiment, six male subjects remained in a sitting position for 45 minutes while inhaling either 1% H2 or a control gas. H2 significantly augmented breath acetone and enhanced oxygen uptake during exercise (P < 0.01).

Although supplementation of H2 has been reported to increase mitochondrial metabolism in animal studies, the effects of the administration of H2 on aerobic capacity during exercise in humans are still not clear. We investigated whether a single or 2-week continuous intake of H2-rich water (HW) enhanced the aerobic capacity during incremental exercise in healthy humans. In this randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled experimental study, the participants performed an incremental cycling exercise to measure peak oxygen uptake and peak load before and after a single (500 mL) or a 2-week supplementation (total 5 L) of HW. In the latter experiment, the participants drank the 500 mL of HW on all weekdays (i.e., 10 times). The single intake of HW did not significantly increase peak oxygen uptake and peak load, and did not significantly alter the responses in oxidative stress, antioxidant activity, and lactate levels. However, importantly, the 2-week continuous consumption of HW significantly augmented peak oxygen uptake and tended to increase the peak load without any significant changes in lactate levels, oxidative stress, and antioxidant responses. In conclusion, the continuous supplementation of HW potentially augments the aerobic capacity, implying that continuous supplementation of H2 might help improve aerobic exercise performance and physical health.

Because of the lack of effective treatments, the disease is a global public health concern. We developed a Si-based agent that continuously generates hydrogen for more than 24 h by reacting with water under conditions similar to those in the gastrointestinal tract. Given the efficacy of hydrogen in the treatment of conditions associated with oxidative stress, we examined whether the Si-based agent had beneficial effects on the development of renal failure. The Si-based agent was orally administered to rats that were developing renal failure. Rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy to establish a remnant kidney model. Specifically, on day -7, rats underwent right 2/3 nephrectomy, followed by light nephrectomy on day 0. Starting on day -3, the rats were administered a control or Si-based agent-containing diet for 8 weeks. Compared with the findings in control rats, the Si-based agent greatly suppressed the increases of both serum creatinine and urinary protein levels. All analyzed parameters of oxidative stress were significantly suppressed in the Si-based agent groups. Histopathological examination illustrated that glomerular hypertrophy was suppressed by the treatment. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that sirtuin 1 and heme oxygenase-1 expression was increased in the Si-based agent groups, suggesting improved antioxidant activity and reduced hypoxia. In addition, caspase-3 and interleukin-6 expression was suppressed in the Si-based agent groups, indicating the alleviation of apoptosis and inflammation. In conclusion, oral administration of a Si-based agent resulted in renoprotective effects, presumably by suppressing oxidative stress via hydrogen generation.

Thus, it is important to examine the factors that promote the RHI. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of molecular hydrogen (H2) on reactive hyperemia-PAT of the small arteries of fingers in healthy people. Methods: To determine the efficacy of H2 for improving peripheral vascular endothelial function, water containing high H2 concentrations was administered to participants, and the Ln_RHI was measured in the finger vasculature. Sixty-eight volunteers were randomly divided into two groups: a placebo group (n = 34) that drank molecular nitrogen (N2)-containing water and a high H2 group (n = 34) that drank high H2 water (containing 7 ppm of H2: 3.5 mg H2 in 500-mL water). The Ln_RHI was measured before ingesting the placebo or high H2 water, 1 h and 24 h after the first ingestion, and 14 days after daily ingestion of high H2 water or the placebo. The mixed effects model for repeated measures was used in data analysis. Results: The high H2 group had a significantly greater improvement in Ln_RHI than the placebo group. Ln_RHI improved by 22.2% (p<0.05) at 24 h after the first ingestion of high H2 water and by 25.4% (p<0.05) after the daily consumption of high H2 water for 2 weeks. Conclusions: Daily consumption of high H2 water improved the endothelial function of the arteries or arterioles assessed by the PAT test. The results suggest that the continuous consumption of high H2 water contributes to improved cardiovascular health.

Although the efficacy of H2 is reportedly attributed to its scavenging capability against the hydroxyl radical, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic efficacy are not fully understood. Herein, we estimated the role of H2 in the energy converting system of the mitochondria, the source of reactive oxygen species. To investigate the effects of H2 on mitochondrial function, direction of electron flow, superoxide generation, and mitochondrial membrane potential were investigated. Forward electron transport (FET) or reverse electron transport (RET) was assessed by monitoring the decrease or increase of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (NADH, - or +, μM, respectively) in the presence of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and/or succinate in the isolated mitochondria. H2O2 converted from superoxide by superoxide dismutase (SOD) was measured to estimate electron leakage in the mitochondria. The effects of H2 on mitochondrial membrane potential were observed by staining cells with the fluorescence probe, teramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). Despite the absence of succinate, a distinct RET was observed (from +0.0313 ± 0.0106 μM to +1.20 ± 0.302 μM) by adding 25 μM H2. In the presence of 5 μM NADH, RET by succinate inverted to FET from +1.62 ± 0.358 μM to -1.83 ± 0.191 μM, accompanied by a suppression of superoxide generated predominantly from complex I by 51.1%. H2 solely reduced mitochondrial membrane potential of the cultured cells by 11.3% as assessed by TMRE. The direction of electron flow was altered by H2 depending on the NAD+/NADH ratio, accompanied by suppression of superoxide generation H2 could suppress superoxide generation in complex I in vitro and reduce membrane potential in vivo. H2 may also neutralize semiquinone radicals to reduce superoxide produced in complex III. H2 may function as a rectifier of the electron flow affecting the mitochondrial membrane potential to suppress oxidative damage in mitochondria.

It contains many hydrogen molecules with high alkaline properties. The physiological effects of ingesting EHW during endurance exercise are unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ingesting EHW during endurance exercise in a heated environment on body fluid balance and exercise performance. Twelve triathletes (20.0 ± 1.3 years, 171 ± 6 cm, 60.6 ± 3.9 kg, V̇O2max 67.1 ± 3.8 mL/kg/min) performed pedaling exercise for 60 min at 65% of V̇O2max consuming either purified water (CON trial) or EHW (EHW trial) and then conducted an incremental pedaling test. Blood parameters, tissue temperature, and respiratory variables were determined during 60 min of exercise. The time to exhaustion (TTE) during the incremental pedaling test was also determined. Body weights were 1.1 ± 0.4 kg lower after exercise, with no significant differences between trials. Plasma volume and serum osmolality and blood sodium and potassium concentrations significantly changed with exercise, but no significant differences were observed between trials. The pH, blood lactate and bicarbonate concentrations, and changes in skin and muscle temperature did not significantly differ between the two trials. Energy expenditure during exercise was significantly (P = 0.04) lower in the EHW trial (13.2 ± 0.5 kcal/min) than in the CON trial (13.7 ± 0.4 kcal/min). TTE did not significantly differ between the trials. In conclusion, EHW ingestion during endurance exercise in a heated environment decreased energy expenditure but did not affect body fluid balance or exercise performance.

Professional athletes (age 23.7 ± 4.0 years; weight 78.6 ± 5.7 kg, height 182.5 ± 4.3 cm; professional experience 5.9 ± 3.9 years) who incurred AAS during a sport-related activity were randomly assigned immediately after the injury to either hydrogen group (n = 9) or a conventional RICE treatment group (n = 9). Hydrogen group received six 30-min ankle baths with HRW throughout the first 24 h post-injury, with hydrotherapy administered every 4 hours during the intervention period. RICE group stood off the injured leg, with ice packs administered for 20 min every 3 hours, with the injured ankle compressed with an elastic bandage for 24 hours and elevated at all possible times above the level of the heart.

Although designed as an immediate therapy to reduce inflammation that occurs after an acute injury, the RICE protcol might not be the best way to promote healing due to limiting blood flow. Molecular hydrogen (H 2) has recently been put forward as a possible adjuvant treatment in musculoskeletal medicine, yet limited data are available concerning its effectiveness as a first-aid intervention.

During the exacerbated systemic inflammatory response at the early stage of sepsis, circulatory inflammatory mediators are able to reach the CNS leading to neuroinflammation and, consequently, long-term impairment in learning and memory formation is observed. The acute treatment with molecular hydrogen (H2) exerts important antioxidative, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects in sepsis, but little is known about the mechanism itself and the efficacy of chronic H2 inhalation in sepsis treatment. Thus, we tested two hypotheses. We first hypothesized that chronic H2 inhalation is also an effective therapy to treat memory impairment induced by sepsis. The second hypothesis is that H2 treatment decreases sepsis-induced neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, important areas related to short and long-term memory processing. Our results indicate that (1) chronic exposure of hydrogen gas is a simple, safe and promising therapeutic strategy to prevent memory loss in patients with sepsis and (2) acute H2 inhalation decreases neuroinflammation in memory-related areas and increases total nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factorthat regulates a vast group of antioxidant and inflammatory agents expression in these areas of septic animals.

After 45 min of ischemia and 6 h of reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed to collect serum and ileum for detection. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to observe the morphology of small intestine. The serum expression levels of intestinal fatty aid binding protein (IFABP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were determined by enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). Imunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blot were used to detect key proteins in intestinal epithelial TJs, ERS, and ERS-induced apoptosis, including occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase-3.

Hydrogen (H2) is a new type of medical gas molecule that has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases in recent years. The aim of the present study was to explore the protective effects of H2 inhalation on brain injury and long-term cognitive impairment in an improved chronic septic mouse model. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomized into four groups: Control, Control + H2, SAE and SAE + H2. The SAE and Control models were established by intraperitoneal injection of human stool suspension or saline in mice. H2 (2%) was inhaled for 60 min at 1 h and 6 h after SAE or Control treatment. The survival rates were recorded for 14 days (days 1-14) and the Morris Water Maze was performed for 7 days (days 8-14). To assess the severity of the brain injury, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, Evans blue (EB) extravasation and the wet/dry weight ratio of brain tissue were detected 24 h after SAE or Control treatment. In addition, inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin 6 (IL-6), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), as well as the protein levels of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Occludin, were measured 6, 12 and 24 h after SAE or Control treatment. The results showed that H2 treatment increased survival rates, mitigated cognitive impairment, reduced hippocampal histological damage, decreased EB and water content, and decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, HMGB1, Nrf2, HO-1, ZO-1 and Occludin, as compared with the SAE group.

Our research team has proven that inhaling 2% hydrogen gas (H2) can effectively improve sepsis and related organ damage, but the specific molecular mechanism of its role is not clear. In this study, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics analysis was used for studying the effect of H2 on intestinal injury in sepsis. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice were used to prepare a sepsis model by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The 7-day survival rates of mice were measured. 4-kd fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Dextran (FITC-dextran) blood concentration measurement, combined with hematoxylin-eosinstain (HE) staining and Western blotting, was used to study the effect of H2 on sepsis-related intestinal damage. iTRAQ-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was used for studying the proteomics associated with H2 for the treatment of intestinal injury. Results: H2 can significantly improve the 7-day survival rates of sepsis mice. The load of blood and peritoneal lavage bacteria was increased, and H2 treatment can significantly reduce it. CLP mice had significant intestinal damage, and inhalation of 2% hydrogen could significantly reduce this damage. All 4194 proteins were quantified, of which 199 differentially expressed proteins were associated with the positive effect of H2 on sepsis. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that H2 may reduce intestinal injury in septic mice through the effects of thyroid hormone synthesis and nitrogen metabolism signaling pathway. Western blot showed that H2 was reduced by down-regulating the expressions of deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 protein (DMBT1), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), N-myc downregulated gene 1 (NDRG1) and serum amyloid A-1 protein (SAA1) intestinal damage in sepsis mice. Conclusion: A total of 199 differential proteins were related with H2 in the intestinal protection of sepsis. H2-related differential proteins were notably enriched in the following signaling pathways, including thyroid hormone synthesis signaling pathway, nitrogen metabolism signaling pathways, digestion and absorption signaling pathways (vitamins, proteins and fats).

The results of the current study demonstrated that HS significantly reduced behavioral, biochemical and molecular effects caused by DPN. However, 5‑hydroxydecanoate, a selective Mito‑K‑ATP channels general pathway inhibitor, partially eliminated the therapeutic effect of HS on DPN. These results indicated that the use of HS may be a novel strategy to treat DPN by activating the Mito‑K‑ATP pathway and reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis.

Transcriptome and gene ontology enrichment analyses showed that the oral nano-Si intake downregulated the biological processes related to oxidative stress, such as immune response, cytokine production, and extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. Alterations in the regulation of a subset of genes in the altered pathways were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the nano-Si treatment alleviated interstitial macrophage infiltration and tubular apoptosis, implicating the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of nano-Si. In conclusion, renal IRI was attenuated by the oral administration of nano-Si, which should be considered as a novel H2 administration method.

Because they are easier to transport and safer to use than inhaled H2, H2-rich solutions are suitable for organ preservation. In this study, we examined the protective effects of an H2-rich solution for lung preservation in a canine left lung transplantation (LTx) model. Methods: Ten beagles underwent orthotopic left LTx after 23 hours of cold ischemia followed by reperfusion for 4 hours. Forty-five minutes after reperfusion, the right main pulmonary artery was clamped to evaluate the function of the implanted graft. The beagles were divided into two groups: control (CON group, n=5) and hydrogen (H2 group, n=5). In the CON group, the donor lungs were flushed and immersed during cold preservation at 4°C using ET-Kyoto solution, and in the H2 group, these were flushed and immersed using H2-rich ET-Kyoto solution. Physiological assessments were performed during reperfusion. After reperfusion, the wet-to-dry ratios were determined, and histological examinations were performed. Results: Significantly higher partial pressure of arterial oxygen and significantly lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide were observed in the H2 group than in the CON group (p=0.045 and p<0.001, respectively). The wet-to-dry ratio was significantly lower in the H2 group than in the CON group (p=0.032). Moreover, in histological examination, less lung injury and fewer apoptotic cells were observed in the H2 group (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the H2-rich preservation solution attenuated ischemia-reperfusion injury in a canine left LTx model. (247 words).

Here, we investigated the effect of constitutive inhalation of hydrogen gas on vascular neointima formation using a cuff-induced vascular injury mouse model. After constitutive inhalation of compressed hydrogen gas (O2 21%, N2 77.7%, hydrogen 1.3%) or compressed air only (O2 21%, N2 79%) by C57BL/6 mice for 2 weeks from 8 weeks of age in a closed chamber, inflammatory cuff injury was induced by polyethylene cuff placement around the femoral artery under anesthesia, and hydrogen gas administration was continued until sampling of the femoral artery. Neointima formation, accompanied by an increase in cell proliferation, was significantly attenuated in the hydrogen group compared with the control group. NADPH oxidase NOX1 downregulation in response to cuff injury was shown in the hydrogen group, but the expression levels of NADPH oxidase subunits, p40phox and p47phox, did not differ significantly between the hydrogen and control groups. Although the increase in superoxide anion production did not significantly differ between the hydrogen and control groups, DNA damage was decreased as a result of reduction of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in the hydrogen group. These results demonstrate that constitutive inhalation of hydrogen gas attenuates vascular remodeling partly via reduction of oxidative stress, suggesting that constitutive inhalation of hydrogen gas at a safe concentration in the living environment could be an effective strategy for prevention of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.

The present study investigated whether ventilation with molecular hydrogen (2.1% H2) or graded restoration of normocapnia with CO2 for 4 h after asphyxia would augment the neuroprotective effect of TH in a subacute (48 h) HIE piglet model. Piglets were randomized to untreated naïve, control-normothermia, asphyxia-normothermia (20-min 4%O2-20%CO2 ventilation; Tcore = 38.5 °C), asphyxia-hypothermia (A-HT, Tcore = 33.5 °C, 2-36 h post-asphyxia), A-HT + H2, or A-HT + CO2 treatment groups. Asphyxia elicited severe hypoxia (pO2 = 19 ± 5 mmHg) and mixed acidosis (pH = 6.79 ± 0.10). HIE development was confirmed by altered cerebral electrical activity and neuropathology. TH was significantly neuroprotective in the caudate nucleus but demonstrated virtually no such effect in the hippocampus. The mRNA levels of apoptosis-inducing factor and caspase-3 showed a ~10-fold increase in the A-HT group compared to naïve animals in the hippocampus but not in the caudate nucleus coinciding with the region-specific neuroprotective effect of TH. H2 or CO2 did not augment TH-induced neuroprotection in any brain areas; rather, CO2 even abolished the neuroprotective effect of TH in the caudate nucleus.

Methods: Eighty young (3 month-old) and aged (12 month-old) male mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n =10 per group) including control group, hydrogen-rich water (HRW) group (10 mL/kg daily), KRG group (50 mg/kg daily) and HRGW group (10 mL/kg and 50 mg/kg daily) by an oral zoned needle for 4 weeks. Sperm count and motility were measured using sperm suspension released from cauda epididymis. Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in serum have also been estimated. Tubular changes were examined through histological hematoxylin and eosin staining. Expression of antioxidation (PPx3, PPx4, GSTm5 and GPx4), spermatogenesis (inhibin-a, neptin-2 and CREM), antiaging (SIRT1 and SIRT2), and angiogenesis [visfatin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] related genes were examined through real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: HRW and KRG treatment stimulated spermatogenesis followed by increasing sperm production and sperm motility (P <0.05). These effects were strengthened synergistically by a HRGW mixture (P <0.05 or P <0.01). HRGW greatly increased the expressions of antioxidation, antiaging, spermatogenesis related genes and VEGF especially in aged mice (P <0.05).

The sequelae of this condition increase the risk of cardiovascular and neurological disease and increased mortality. Its pathophysiology is associated with redox dysregulation, excessive inflammation, and perturbation of cellular homeostasis. Molecular hydrogen (H2) may attenuate oxidative stress, improve cellular function, and reduce chronic inflammation. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown promising effects of H2-rich water (HRW) on specific features of metabolic syndrome, yet the effects of long-term, high-concentration HRW in this prevalent condition remain poorly addressed. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 60 subjects (30 men and 30 women) with metabolic syndrome. An initial observation period of one week was used to acquire baseline clinical data followed by randomization to either placebo or high-concentration HRW (> 5.5 millimoles of H2 per day) for 24 weeks. Results: Supplementation with high-concentration HRW significantly reduced blood cholesterol and glucose levels, attenuated serum hemoglobin A1c, and improved biomarkers of inflammation and redox homeostasis as compared to placebo (P < 0.05). Furthermore, H2 tended to promote a mild reduction in body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio. Conclusion: Our results give further credence that high-concentration HRW might have promising effects as a therapeutic modality for attenuating risk factors of metabolic syndrome.

Herein, the radioactive elimination and radioprotective effect of hydrogen-rich water (HRW), a potential antioxidant with various medical applications, on tritiated water (HTO) exposure, was studied in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that intragastric administration of HRW effectively promoted the elimination of urinary tritium, decreased the level of serum tritium and tissue-bound tritium (OBT), and attenuated the genetic damage of blood cells in mice exposed to HTO (18.5 MBq/kg). Pretreatment with HRW effectively reduces tritium accumulation in HTO-treated human blood B lymphocyte AHH-1 cells. In addition, the anti-oxidative properties of HRW could attenuate the increased intracellular ROS (such as O2•-, •OH and ONOO-), resulting in reversing the exhaustion of cellular endogenous antioxidants (reduced GSH and SOD), decreasing lipid peroxidation (MDA), relieving DNA oxidative damage, and depressing cell apoptosis and cytotoxicity induced by HTO exposure. In conclusion, HRW is expected to be an effective radioactive elimination agent through the competition effect of isotope exchange or a radioprotective agent by scavenging free radicals induced by HTO exposure.

The present study aimed to explore the roles of H2 in lung cancer cell autophagy, and reveal the effects of autophagy on H2-mediated lung cancer cell apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms. The expression levels of proteins associated with cell apoptosis and autophagy were detected using western blot analysis. Cell autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine treatment or Beclin1 downregulation, while rapamycin was used to induce autophagy. Cell growth and apoptosis were detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The results demonstrated that cell apoptosis and autophagy were significantly enhanced in the A549 and H1975 lung cancer cell lines treated with H2. However, autophagy enhancement weakened H2 roles in promoting cell apoptosis and vice versa. In addition, it was found that H2 treatment induced marked decreases in the protein expression levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and Bcl2, and overexpression of STAT3 abolished H2 roles in promoting cell apoptosis and autophagy. Overall, the present study revealed that H2 can promote lung cancer cell apoptosis and autophagy via inhibiting the activation of STAT3/Bcl2 signaling and suppression of autophagy can enhance H2 roles in promoting lung cancer cell apoptosis.

The interactions between the H2 and the local cells are of great interest, and a full understanding of the effect of H2 on bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) would accelerate the development of effective strategies for successful bony healing. This study investigates how H2, with different concentrations and durations, regulates the osteoclastogenesis of mouse BMMCs. First, using H2 with five concentrations (0%, 2%, 25%, 50% and 75%) and three durations (5, 7 and 10 days), the osteoclastogenesis of mouse BMMCs in these H2 conditions were measured using TRAP staining, F-actin ring formation assay, pit formation assay and RT-qPCR analysis. Based on these findings, the proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, western blot analysis and ELISA assay of BMMCs after osteoclast induction were performed. The findings showed that H2 (especially the 50% and 75% H2) obviously inhibited the osteoclast formation, function and osteoclast-related genes expression of osteoclast-induced BMMCs; additionally, H2 (50%) was found to reduce the proliferation, promote the apoptosis and inhibit the expression of osteoclast-related proteins of BMMCs with the presence of osteoclast-induced medium. Therefore, H2 significantly inhibited the osteoclastogenesis of mouse BMMCs, which may become a new therapeutic agent for anti-bony resorption and open new avenues for the translational research of Mg alloys.",Positive,Cell Culture,Bone,Surgery/Transplantation,Bone Loss,Gas,N/A,Ventilation,,,China

However, long-term peritoneal dialysis treatment causes peritoneal fibrosis. In recent years, the application potential of molecular hydrogen in the biomedicine has been well recognized. Molecular hydrogen selectively scavenges cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acts as an antioxidant. In this experiment, a high glucose-induced peritoneal fibrosis mouse model was successfully established by intraperitoneal injection of high glucose peritoneal dialysate, and peritoneal fibrosis mice were treated with hydrogen-rich peritoneal dialysate. In addition, in vitro studies of high glucose-induced peritoneal fibrosis were performed using MeT-5A cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that molecular hydrogen could inhibit peritoneal fibrosis progress induced by high glucose effectively. Furthermore, it has been found that molecular hydrogen alleviate fibrosis by eliminating intracellular ROS and inhibiting the activation of the PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway. The present data proposes that molecular hydrogen exerts the capacity of anti-peritoneal fibrosis through the ROS/PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway.

Although hydrogen-rich water (HRW) has been used to prevent various oxidative stress-related diseases, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of HRW on CsA-induced nephrotoxicity and its potential mechanisms. After administration of CsA (25 mg/kg/day), rats were treated with or without HRW (12 mL/kg) for 4 weeks. Renal function and vascular activity were investigated. Histological changes in kidney tissues were analyzed using Masson's trichrome and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling stains. Oxidative stress markers and the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway were also measured. We found that CsA increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malonaldehyde (MDA), but it reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Such alterations induced vascular dysfunction, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular apoptosis. This was evident secondary to an increase in urinary protein, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen, ultimately leading to renal dysfunction. Conversely, HRW decreased levels of ROS and MDA while increasing the activity of GSH and SOD. This was accompanied by an improvement in vascular and renal function. Moreover, HRW significantly decreased the level of Keap1 and increased the expression of Nrf2, NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1, and heme oxygenase 1. In conclusion, HRW restored the balance of redox status, suppressed oxidative stress damage, and improved kidney function induced by CsA via activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.

What’ s more, some studies have demonstrated that 2 percent of hydrogen or hydrogen water is effective in treating and preventing various diseases. Objectives The aim of this study was to observe the effect of hydrogen on the expression of SIgA, PIgR, IL-4, IL-5, TGF-β1 and IL-40 in lung tissue of COPD rats, to study the relationship between lung pathology parameter and SIgA, PIgR, therefore we can understand the effect of hydrogen on the development of COPD by changing SIgA expression of airway mucosal in COPD rats. Methods A rat model of COPD was established by cigarette smoke exposure, and different concentrations of hydrogen were inhaled as intervention measures. After 4 months of cigarette smoke exposure, pathologic changes and airway wall remodeling of the lung were assessed by optical microscope. The protein expressions of SIgA, PIgR, IL-4, IL-5, TGF-β1 as well as IL-40 in the lung tissues were observed by immunohistochemistry or Western blot. The correlation between lung pathology parameter and the expression of SIgA, PIgR was analyzed. The correlation between SIgA and the expression of IL-4, IL-5, TGF-β1 and IL-40 was analyzed. Results The results showed that hydrogen inhalation significantly ameliorated lung pathology and airway wall remodeling, increased the protein expression of SIgA, PIgR, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-40, and reduced the protein expression of TGF-β1. Conclusions Inhalation of 22% and 41.6% hydrogen showed a better effect than inhalation of 2% hydrogen.

In our previous study, our project group found that H2 could decreased the expression of CD47 in lung cancer A549 cells via using the next generation sequencing, indicating that CD47 might be involved in H2-mediated lung cancer repression. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of CD47 on H2-induced lung cancer repression. Western blotting and RT-PCR assays were used to detect the levels of proteins and mRNAs, respectively. Cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis were detected by using the CCK-8, Transwell chambers, wound healing and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The results showed that H2 treatment caused decreases in the expression levels of CD47 and cell division control protein 42 (CDC42) in a dose-dependent manner. Upregulation of CD47 abolished H2 roles in promoting lung cancer cell apoptosis and repressing cell growth, invasion and migration in both A549 and H1975 cell lines. However, knockdown of CD47 enhanced H2 role in lung cancer inhibition. Moreover, we also observed that H2 treatment induced obvious inhibitions in the expression levels of CDC42 and CD47 in mice tumor tissues, as well as reinforced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis in A549 and H1975 cells.

This study explored the possibility that H2 exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by modulating energy metabolic pathway switch. Activities of glycolytic and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation systems were assessed in asthmatic patients and in mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. The effects of hydrogen treatment on airway inflammation and on changes in activities of these two pathways were evaluated. Monocytes from asthmatic patients and lungs from ovalbumin-sensitized and challenged mice had increased lactate production and glycolytic enzyme activities (enhanced glycolysis), accompanied by decreased ATP production and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and III activities (suppressed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation), indicating an energy metabolic pathway switch. Treatment of ovalbumin-sensitized and challenged mice with hydrogen reversed the energy metabolic pathway switch, and mitigated airway inflammation. Hydrogen abrogated ovalbumin sensitization and challenge-induced upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and downregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α. Hydrogen abrogated ovalbumin sensitization and challenge-induced sirtuins 1, 3, 5 and 6 downregulation. Our data demonstrates that allergic airway inflammation is associated with an energy metabolic pathway switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Hydrogen inhibits airway inflammation by reversing this switch. Hydrogen regulates energy metabolic reprogramming by acting at multiple levels in the energy metabolism regulation pathways.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) has recently emerged as a powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic molecule in a number of pathological conditions, but little is known about its putative role under physiological conditions such as physical exercise. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that H2 decreases intense acute exercise-induced inflammation in the hippocampus, since it is a brain region particularly susceptible to inflammation. Moreover, we also assessed hippocampus oxidative status. Rats ran on a sealed treadmill inhaling either the H2 (2% H2, 21% O2, balanced with N2) or the control gas (0% H2, 21% O2, balanced with N2) and hippocampal samples were collected immediately or 3 h after exercise. We measured hippocampal levels of cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-10] and oxidative markers [superoxide dismutase (SOD), thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and nitrite/nitrate (NOx)]. Exercise increased TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 immediately after the session, whereas no change in IL-1β levels was observed. Conversely, exercise did not cause any change in SOD activity, TBARS and NOx levels. H2 inhibited the exercise-induced surges in TNF-α and IL-6, and potentiated the IL-10 surge, immediately after the exercise. Moreover, no change in IL1-β levels of rats inhaling H2 was observed. Regarding the oxidative stress markers, H2 failed to cause any change in SOD activity, TBARS and NOx levels. No significant change was observed in any of the assessed parameters 3 h after the exercise bout. These data are consistent with the notion that H2 acts as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent not only down-modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) but also upregulating an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) production without affecting the local oxidative stress status. These data indicate that H2 effectively decreases exercise-induced inflammation in the hippocampus, despite the fact that this region is particularly prone to inflammatory insults.

In a double-blind crossover design, 14 endurance-trained male runners (age, 34 ± 4 years; body mass, 63.1 ± 7.2 kg; height, 1.72 ± 0.05 m) were randomly assigned to ingest 2 doses of 290-mL H2-water or placebo on each occasion. The first bolus was given before six 4-min submaximal running bouts, and the second bolus was consumed before the maximal incremental running test. Expired gas, heart rate (HR), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded; blood samples were collected at the end of each submaximal stage and post maximal running test. Cardiorespiratory responses, RPE, and blood gas indices were not significantly different at each submaximal running intensity (range: 34%-91% maximal oxygen uptake) between H2-water and placebo trials. No statistical difference was observed in running time to exhaustion (618 ± 126 vs. 619 ± 113 s), maximal oxygen uptake (56.9 ± 4.4 vs. 57.1 ± 4.7 mL·kg-1·min-1), maximal HR (184 ± 7 vs. 184 ± 7 beat·min-1), and RPE (19 ± 1 vs. 19 ± 1) in the runners between the trials. The results suggest that the ingestion of 290 mL of H2-water before submaximal treadmill running and an additional dose before the subsequent incremental running to exhaustion were not sufficiently ergogenic in endurance-trained athletes.

Several studies have suggested that inhaled hydrogen can protect lung grafts from ischemia-reperfusion injury via anti-inflammatory and -oxidative mechanisms. We investigated whether molecular hydrogen-saturated water can preserve lung allograft function in a heterotopic tracheal allograft mouse model of obliterative airway disease METHODS: Obliterative airway disease was induced by heterotopically transplanting tracheal allografts from BALB/c donor mice into C57BL/6 recipient mice, which were subsequently administered hydrogen water (10 ppm) or tap water (control group) (n = 6 each) daily without any immunosuppressive treatment. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on days 7, 14, and 21. Results: Hydrogen water decreased airway occlusion on day 14. No significant histological differences were observed on days 7 or 21. The cluster of differentiation 4/cluster of differentiation 3 ratio in tracheal allografts on day 14 was higher in the hydrogen water group than in control mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay performed on day 7 revealed that hydrogen water reduced the level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and increased that of forkhead box P3 transcription factor, suggesting an enhancement of regulatory T cell activity. Conclusions: Hydrogen water suppressed the development of mid-term obliterative airway disease in a mouse tracheal allograft model via anti-oxidant and -inflammatory mechanisms and through the activation of Tregs. Thus, hydrogen water is a potential treatment strategy for BOS that can improve the outcome of lung transplant patients.

The detrimental effects of radiation are mostly mediated via the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the hydroxyl radical (·OH). Because hydrogen is a selective ·OH scavenger, we hypothesized that hydrogen might exert a protective effect against radiation-induced intestinal damage. Herein, radiation models were built both in mice and in an intestinal crypt epithelial cell (IEC-6) line. In the animal experiment, we demonstrated that hydrogen-rich saline significantly reduced radiation-induced intestinal mucosal damage, improved intestinal function, and increased the survival rate. In addition, radiation-induced oxidative stress damage and systemic inflammatory response were also mitigated by hydrogen treatment. Moreover, hydrogen treatment decreased cell apoptosis and maintained intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in mice. In vitro experiments using the IEC-6 cell line showed that hydrogen-rich medium significantly inhibited ROS formation, maintained cell viability, and inhibited cell apoptosis. Importantly, hydrogen treatment prevented mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and activity of caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP. Moreover, the decreased expression of Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 and the increased expression of Bax protein were also blocked by hydrogen treatment. In conclusion, our study concurrently demonstrated that hydrogen provides an obviously protective effect on radiation-induced intestinal and cell injuries. Our work demonstrated that this protective effect might be due to the blockage of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.",Positive,Mouse,Intestine,Cancer,Oxidative Stress,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

The mixed Th1/Th2 immune response is required against Trypanosoma cruzi. Electrolyzed oxidizing water (EOW) has been shown to have germicidal efficacy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the EOW effectiveness in T. cruzi-infected BALB/c mice clinically, immunologically, and histologically. The severity of the infection was assessed by parasitaemia, general health condition, mortality, mega syndromes, and histological lesions. IgG, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-1 beta levels were quantified. The EOW administration showed a beneficial effect on parasitaemia, general physical condition, and mortality. High levels of IgG1 at 50 days postinfection were observed. Prophylactic EOW treatment was able to induce a predominantly TH1 immune response based on an IgG2a levels increase at the late acute phase, and a 10-fold increase of INF-gamma in whole acute phase. EOW was able to control the acute phase infection as effectively as benznidazole. Splenomegaly was caused by EOW treatment and lymphadenopathy was stimulated by T. cruzi infection in all groups. Severe tissue damage was not prevented by EOW treatments. Moderate efficacy may be due to immunomodulatory properties and not to a direct toxic effect on the parasite.

The aim of this study is to acknowledge the protective effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) solution on a rat hindlimb degloved skin flap. Methods: Twenty-one Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (control, saline and HRS). Degloving injury model was established, and flaps were sutured back following 5 min of ischemia. The control group did not receive any treatment. The saline group received intraperitoneal physiological saline (10 ml/kg) and the HRS group received intraperitoneal HRS solution (10 ml/kg) postoperatively and daily for 5 days after the operation. Skin samples were obtained for histological, immunohistochemical and biochemical evaluations. Results: Inflammation was lower in the HRS compared with saline (p = 0.02) and control (p = 0.004) groups. Edema was lower in the HRS compared with saline (p = 0.02) and control (p = 0.001) groups. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level was lower in the HRS than the control group (p = 0.01). Total antioxidant level was higher in the HRS compared with saline (p = 0.009) and control (p = 0.03) groups. Total oxidant level was lower in the HRS than the control group (p = 0.02). Oxidative stress index was lower in the HRS compared with saline (p = 0.001) and control (p = 0.0001) groups'. Vascular proliferation was higher in the HRS compared with the control group (p = 0.01).

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of H2 in HS/R is unclear. Endothelial glycocalyx (EG) damage causes hemodynamic failure associated with HS/R. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that H2 alleviates oxidative stress by suppressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and/or preventing tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α)-mediated syndecan-1 shedding during EG damage. Methods: HS/R was induced in rats by reducing mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 35 mm Hg for 60 min followed by resuscitation. Rats inhaled oxygen or H2 + oxygen after achieving shock either in the presence or absence of an XOR inhibitor (XOR-I) for both the groups. In a second test, rats received oxygen alone or antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α monoclonal antibody with oxygen or H2. Two hours after resuscitation, XOR activity, purine metabolites, cytokines, syndecan-1 were measured and survival rates were assessed 6 h after resuscitation. Results: H2 and XOR-I both suppressed MAP reduction and improved survival rates. H2 did not affect XOR activity and the therapeutic effects of XOR-I and H2 were additive. H2 suppressed plasma TNF-α and syndecan-1 expression; however, no additional H2 therapeutic effect was observed in the presence of anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody. Conclusions: H2 inhalation after shock stabilized hemodynamics and improved survival rates in an HS/R model independent of XOR. The therapeutic action of H2 was partially mediated by inhibition of TNF-α-dependent syndecan-1 shedding.

We investigated the dependencies of DH and ORP on mineral-based hardness, temperatures and the container materials, and effects on the oral cavity by oral washing or drinking. Along with an increase in mineral-based water-hardness, DH decreased from 960 to 870 μg/L and the ORP unexpectedly increased from -460 to -320 mV. Purified water of almost zero hardness, however, caused a post-electrolytic DH as low as 80 μg/L and an ORP as high as +20 mV. Post-electrolytic DHs were not significantly changed (780-900 μg/L) upon electrolysis at 1.5-30°C and decreased at 40-50°C. The diffusion of hydrogen from the inside to the outside of the container was extremely small even after 12 hours for an aluminum- or stainless steel-made container, but not for containers made of diverse plastics. The ORP of the intact saliva was +136 mV, and decreased to +90 mV at 20 minutes after 1-minute oral-cramming of hydrogen-water, but returned to +135 mV after 60-minute leaving, showing a transient ORP-decrease in the saliva. Drinking-pause for 4 weeks after drinking hydrogen-water, however, saliva ORP, gradually but not instantly, increased to +60 to +80 mV, but upon drinking-resumption and 2 weeks thereafter, decreased again to -100 to -110 mV, suggesting that several-week hydrogen-water drinking caused a certain decrease in the saliva ORP. Thus, the present study provided the appropriate conditions such as hardness and temperatures for hydrogen-water production by the electrolytic generator, and the container materials suitable for hydrogen-water preservation.

Previous studies indicated that hydrogen-rich water (HRW) might be a helpful topical intervention to boost recovery in musculoskeletal medicine, yet no data are available concerning the effectiveness and safety of whole-body bathing with supersaturated HRW after DOMS-inducing exercise. This study evaluates the effects of a single-session bathing with HRW on biochemical markers of muscular damage in healthy young men. The six volunteers who were exposed to DOMS-inducing eccentric exercise were assigned to either supersaturated HRW or control whole-body bathing in a double-blind crossover design. Immediately after an exercise session, the participants were immersed up to the neck into a 200 L bathtub with supersaturated HRW (8 mg of H2 per L) or control water (no hydrogen) for 30 min. Blood biomarkers of inflammation and muscular damage and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for muscle soreness were assessed at baseline (before exercise) and at 24-hour follow-up. Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference between two groups in serum creatine kinase (CK) response over the period of intervention (P=0.04). A single-session bathing in HRW prevented a rise in circulating biomarkers of muscular damage induced by exercise at 24-hour follow-up, retaining the levels of all biomarkers similar to the baseline values (P > 0.05). On the other hand, serum CK, aldolase, and aspartate transaminase were significantly elevated at 24-hour follow-up as compared to the baseline levels after the control bath (342 ± 309 U/L vs. 465 ± 295 U/L; P > 0.05). HRW bath also induced a significant drop in VAS scores for muscle soreness in comparison with control water, both immediately after an intervention (32.7 ± 8.6% vs. 20.0 ± 12.8%; P=0.02) and at 24-hour follow-up (31.6 ± 24.3% vs. 22.4 ± 27.5%; P=0.03), respectively.

The present study aimed to compare the antimicrobial effect of electrolyzed water (EW), (acidic, mildly basic, and basic) on the growth of bacterial species producing dental plaque and to assess their cytotoxicity on fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Methods: The study was performed at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in 2019. Several bacterial species (Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus casei, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) were treated with different EW types at three pH values (3, 9, and 11) for 30 seconds and subsequently, the colonies were counted. The cytotoxic effect of these EW types was evaluated on HeLa and L929 cell lines at 30 seconds, 1 minute, and 5 minutes. GraphPad Prism 6.0 was used for statistical analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test were used to analyze bacterial activity and cell cytotoxicity, respectively. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: EW types significantly inhibited bacterial growth at all pH values. The strongest antibacterial activity of EW was against A. actinomycetemcomitans (P<0.001) and the least significant antibacterial activity was against S. aureus (P<0.001). The EW types showed increased cytotoxic activity against L929 cells as the treatment time increased. The most cytotoxic effect was seen at 5 minutes of treatment in all EW types compared with the negative control group (P<0.0001). This negative cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells was shown just after 30 seconds and viable cell counts increased over time, reaching its highest value at 5 minutes of treatment with basic EW (P<0.0001). Conclusion: The contradictory effects of the EW types on both HeLa and fibroblasts, in addition to variable results at different exposure times, indicated that the effect of EW could vary depending on cell types and treatment periods.",Positive,Cell Culture,Mouth,Periodontitis,Pathogenic Bacterial Load,Water (Electrolysis),Mixed,Irrigation,,,Iran

Recent advancements in hydrogen (H2) gas offer a promising therapeutic approach for ischemia reperfusion injury; however, the impact of this approach for HIE remains a subject of debate. We assessed the therapeutic effects of H2 gas on HIE and the underlying molecular mechanisms in a rat model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI). H2 inhalation significantly attenuated neuronal injury and effectively improved early neurological outcomes in neonatal HIBI rats as well as learning and memory in adults. This protective effect was associated with initiation time and duration of sustained H2 inhalation. Furthermore, H2 inhalation reduced the expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) and caspase-3 while promoting the expression of Bcl-2, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). H2 activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase and dephosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells. Inhibitors of MAPKs blocked H2-induced HO-1 expression. HO-1 small interfering RNA decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and reversed the protectivity of H2 against OGD/R-induced cell death. These findings suggest that H2 augments cellular antioxidant defense capacity through activation of MAPK signaling pathways, leading to HO-1 expression and subsequent upregulation of PGC-1α and SIRT-1 expression. Thus, upregulation protects NGF-differentiated PC12 cells from OGD/R-induced oxidative cytotoxicity. In conclusion, H2 inhalation exerted protective effects on neonatal rats with HIBI. Early initiation and prolonged H2 inhalation had better protective effects on HIBI. These effects of H2 may be related to antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory responses. HO-1 plays an important role in H2-mediated protection through the MAPK/HO-1/PGC-1α pathway. Our results support further assessment of H2 as a potential therapeutic for neurological conditions in which oxidative stress and apoptosis are implicated. 1. Background Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a severe disease with high neonatal morbidity and mortality; 25% of HIE survivors have permanent neurological defects [1]. Before irreversible brain injury occurs, the specific pathological process of hypoxia-ischemia (HI) occurs through a combination of multiple mechanisms [2, 3]. The severity and duration of these mechanisms determine the extent of brain injury in HIE [4]. Molecular hydrogen (H2) easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier and is a novel antioxidant [5]. Previous studies have shown that H2 mitigates ischemia/reperfusion- (I/R-) induced injury to different organs [6–8]. However, the neuroprotective effects of H2 treatment on hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) are controversial. For example, a recent study showed that H2-enriched water exerts neuroprotective effects on brain tissue after induction of HIBI [9]. However, another study found no protective effects [10]. Oxidative stress is a well-recognized consequence of HIE and is considered an important contributor to early brain injury after HI [11] working in combination with inflammation [12]. Growing evidence suggests that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation underpin a diverse range of central nervous system (CNS) diseases including stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurodegenerative diseases [13–15]. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an important component of the cellular defense enzyme that is induced by and acts against oxidant-induced I/R injury [16]. HO-1 overexpression may also affect the regulation of apoptotic pathway genes such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAS), and caspases [17]. HO-1 has antineuroinflammatory and neuroprotective properties in the CNS [18, 19]. Thus, therapies targeting HO-1 may be potential treatments for protection against inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis after HI. Multiple signaling kinases related to cell survival and proliferation reportedly regulate the nuclear translocation of HO-1. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are some of the most common signaling pathways, which serve to coordinate the cellular response to a variety of extracellular stimuli [20]. These are well characterized in mammals and include c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [21, 22]. Activation of MAPKs modulates HO-1 expression [23]. In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of H2 on neonatal HIBI rats through behavioral tests, immunofluorescence, and western blot analysis to determine the appropriate therapeutic window for of H2. In vivo, we also tested the expression of high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), the apoptosis-related factors Bcl-2/BAX-caspase3, and the oxidative stress signaling molecules p38 MAPK/Nrf2/HO-1. Then, we investigated the potential MAPK/HO-1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) signaling pathway in nerve growth factor- (NGF-) differentiated PC12 cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). 2. Methods 2.1. Experimental Design In Vivo A total of 320 neonatal rats were randomly divided into the following eight groups (): HIBI, HIBI+H2-30 min, HIBI+H2-60 min, HIBI+H2-90 min, HIBI+H2-90 min (12 h), HIBI+H2-90 min (24 h), sham surgery, and control. Animals in the HIBI and all HIBI+H2 treatment groups were rats with induced HIBI. After establishing the HIBI model, neonatal rats in the HIBI+H2-30 min, HIBI+H2-60 min, and HIBI+H2-90 min groups were immediately placed in a box for 30, 60, or 90 min of H2 inhalation, respectively. This was followed by twice daily H2 inhalation (30, 60, or 90 min each time) over the next 3 days (7 : 00–9 : 00 am and 7 : 00–9 : 00 pm). Animals in the HIBI+H2-90 min (12 h) and HIBI+H2-90 min (24 h) groups underwent 3% H2 inhalation for 90 min at 12 and 24 h, respectively, after induction of HI. This was followed by twice daily H2 inhalation for 90 min for 3 days. Animals in the sham surgery group underwent left carotid artery isolation without ligation and hypoxia induction. Animals in the control group were healthy neonatal rats without induction of HIBI. Detection of early neurological reflexes was performed ~24 h after HIBI induction, and then some neonatal rats were subjected to triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining (). At 96 h after inducing HIBI, brain samples from neonatal rats were collected for western blotting, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and immunofluorescence staining. In addition, some of the neonatal rats () in adulthood (postnatal days 70–74) underwent testing in a Morris water maze (Figure 1).

Hydrogen (H2), a flammable, colorless, and odorless gas, has been observed to have preventive and therapeutic effects on brain trauma and other neurological disorders, but its exact mechanism has not been fully clarified. Methods: To further study the mechanism underlying the role of hydrogen gas in alleviating BBB damage after TBI, we performed the scratch injury model on cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3), which formed the microvascular endothelial barrier – an integral part of the highly specialized BBB. Results: In the case of TBI, hydrogen was able to improve the decline of cell viability induced by TBI. More importantly, inhibition of PI3 K/Akt/GSK3β signal pathway or activation of autophagy reduced the protective effect of hydrogen on cell viability, indicating that such protective effect was regulated by PI3 K/Akt/GSK3β signal pathway and was related to the inhibition of autophagy. Conclusion: So we concluded that hydrogen improved the cell viability in a microvascular endothelial cell model of TBI partly through inhibition of autophagy, and inhibitory effect of hydrogen on autophagy was exerted by activating PI3 K/Akt/GSK3β signal pathway.

Continuous exposure to METH leads to behavioral sensitization in animals, which can be used as a behavioral model with many mechanisms in common with relapse in humans. Molecular hydrogen has recently gained attention for its potential as a novel healthcare product with preventive and therapeutic applicability to a wide range of pathological conditions. However, it remains unclear whether and, if so, how hydrogen regulates METH-induced behavioral abnormalities. In the present study, we investigated the roles of molecular hydrogen on the acquisition and transfer of METH-induced behavioral sensitization and the accompanying changes in ERK phosphorylation and ΔFosB activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice. To this end, male C57BL/6 mice received METH (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) injections for 7 days followed by a METH challenge (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) after a 7-day transfer period. Molecular hydrogen, delivered through a hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) injection (10 mL/kg, i.p., 3-h interval), was administered during the acquisition and transfer periods. We found that HRS administration was able to inhibit the acquisition and transfer of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg METH-induced behavioral sensitization to a certain extent, thereby attenuating the expression of behavioral sensitization. The HRS injections alone did not induce any obvious changes in locomotor activity in mice. Intriguingly, the increases in pERK and ΔFosB in the NAc, which accompanied the METH-induced behavioral sensitization, were also attenuated by the HRS treatments. Due to the anti-oxidative function of molecular hydrogen, the HRS injections reduced METH-induced reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde generation in the NAc. These results suggest that molecular hydrogen serves as an anti-oxidative agent with potentially therapeutic applicability to the treatment of METH addicts.

Hydrogen gas is a new medical gas that exerts anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and anti-apoptotic effects and can effectively protect septic mice. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which can be improved by mitochondrial biogenesis, is a type of molecular pathology in sepsis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), which can be inhibited by SR-18292, is the key regulatory factor of mitochondrial biogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the effects of hydrogen gas on mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis in mice with SAE and the related regulatory mechanisms. Cecal ligation and puncture was used to induce sepsis in mice. The mice with hydrogen gas therapy were exposed to 2% H2 inhalation for 1 h beginning at both 1 and 6 h after operation, and mice were also injected with a PGC-1α inhibitor, SR-18292. We recorded the 7-day survival rates of the mice and detected their cognitive function using a Y-maze test. The Nissl bodies in the CA1 region of hippocampus were observed by Nissl staining, and the apoptotic cells were observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, and mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and II were analyzed using commercial kits. The mitochondrial morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of PGC-1α, nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF2), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) were detected by Western blot analysis. The present study showed that hydrogen gas therapy increased the 7-day survival rate, improved cognitive function, increased the mitochondrial function (MMP, ATP level, complex I activity) and expression of mitochondrial biogenesis parameters (PGC-1α, NRF2, Tfam). However, the injection of SR-18292 (a PGC-1α inhibitor) decreased mitochondrial function, PGC-1α activation, and expression of NRF2 and Tfam.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the cytoprotective efficacy of intraluminally administered hydrogen-rich saline on cold IR injury in intestinal transplantation. Isogeneic intestinal transplantation with 6 hours of cold ischemia was performed on Lewis rats. Hydrogen-rich saline (H2 concentration at 5 ppm) or normal saline was intraluminally introduced immediately before preservation. Graft intestine was excised 3 hours after reperfusion and analyzed.

Hydrogen has anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiapoptotic properties against various diseases. However, the effect of hydrogen on coagulation dysfunction after intestinal I/R and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore whether hydrogen-rich solution (HRS) could attenuate coagulation disorders and inflammation to improve intestinal injury and poor survival following intestinal I/R. The rat model of intestinal I/R injury was established by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 90 min and reperfusion for 2 h. HRS (10 or 20 mL/kg) or 20 mL/kg 0.9% normal saline was intravenously injected at 10 min before reperfusion, respectively. The samples were harvested at 2 h after reperfusion for further analyses. Moreover, the survival rate was observed for 24 h. The results showed that HRS improved the survival rate and alleviated serum diamine oxidase activities, intestinal injury, edema, and apoptosis. Interestingly, HRS markedly improved intestinal I/R-mediated coagulation disorders as evidenced by abnormal conventional indicators of coagulation and thromboelastography.

Hydrogen exerts a biphasic effect on cancer by promoting tumor cell death and protecting normal cells, which might initiate GSDMD pathway-mediated pyroptosis. Methods: We performed immunohistochemical staining and western immunoblotting analysis to observe expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD in human and xenograft mice endometrial cancer tissue and cell lines. We investigated treatment with hydrogen could boost ROS accumulation in endometrial cancer cells by intracellular and mitochondrial sources. GSDMD shRNA lentivirus was used to transfect endometrial cancer cells to investigate the function of GSDMD protein in pyroptosis. Propidium iodide (PI) staining, TUNEL assay, measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and IL-1β ELISA were used to analysis pyroptosis between hydrogen-supplemented or normal culture medium. We conducted in vivo human endometrial tumor xenograft mice model to observe anti-tumor effect in hydrogen supplementation. Results: We observed overexpression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD in human endometrial cancer and cell lines by IHC and western immunoblotting. Hydrogen pretreatment upregulated ROS and the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, and increased the number of PI- and TUNEL-positive cells, as well as the release of LDH and IL-1β, however, GSDMD depletion reduced their release. We further demonstrated that hydrogen supplementation in mice was sufficient for the anti-tumor effect to inhibit xenograft volume and weight of endometrial tumors, as mice subjected to hydrogen-rich water displayed decreased radiance. Tumor tissue sections in the HRW groups presented moderate-to-strong positive expression of NLRP3, caspase-1 and GSDMD. Hydrogen attenuated tumor volume and weight in a xenograft mouse model though the pyroptotic pathway. Conclusions: This study extended our original analysis of the ability of hydrogen to stimulate NLRP3 inflammasome/GSDMD activation in pyroptosis and revealed possible mechanism (s) for improvement of anti-tumor effects in the clinical management of endometrial cancer.

Methods: The 280 male wild-type (WT) and Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2-KO) ICR mice (6-8 weeks old, 20-25 g weight) were assigned into 8 groups randomly (WT and Nrf2-KO mice, 4 groups respectively, n = 35): Sham group, H2 inhalation group (Sham+H2 group), sepsis model group which was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP group) and H2 treatment group (CLP+H2 group). In Sham group, except cecal ligation and perforation, the same surgery was used. The mice in Sham group and CLP group inhaled only air for 1 hour and 6 hours, respectively, while the mice in Sham+H2 group and CLP+H2 group inhaled 2% H2 for 60 minutes. After modeling, 20 mice randomly in each group were selected to measure 7-day natural survival rates; the remaining mice(15 mice) were killed in 24 hours after modeling, and the bacterial load was determined by collecting the peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) of each mouse to measure the colony forming unit (CFU); and the intestinal tissue was taken after perfusion, and the intestinal tissue of 3 mice was used to extract protein for HO-1 and HMGB1 levels by using Western blotting. Intestinal tissue of 3 mice was extracted to prepare histomorphology sections for the identification of HO-1. Intestinal tissue of 3 mice was used to detect the expression of HMGB1 by immunofluorescence. Results: The 7-day survival rate of WT and Nrf2-KO mice in CLP group was zero; in WT mice, the 7-day survival rate of CLP+H2 group was significantly higher than that of CLP group (45% vs. 0%, P < 0.05), while no difference of the 7-day survival rate in Nrf2-KO mice was noted between CLP and CLP+H2 groups (0% vs. 0%, P > 0.05). Compared with Sham group, the CFU in the PLF of both mice in CLP group increased significantly. Compared with CLP group, 2% H2 treatment could significantly improve the bacterial clearance rate of WT mice with severe sepsis (CFU, ×103: 34.7±6.3 vs. 74.2±8.1, P < 0.01), but had no significant effect on Nrf2-KO mice with severe sepsis (CFU, ×103: 73.3±7.5 vs. 75.8±8.6, P > 0.05). The results of Western blotting, immunohistochemical and immune-fluorescence showed that the expression of HO-1 and HMGB1 in the CLP group were higher than those in the Sham group. Compared with CLP group, the expression of HO-1 in WT mice of CLP+H2 group was significantly higher [HO-1 protein expression (HO-1/β-actin): 0.716±0.035 vs. 0.460±0.045, HO-1 positive expression (A value): 0.703±0.135 vs. 0.430±0.116, both P < 0.01], while the expression of HMGB1 was significantly lower [HMGB1 protein expression (HMGB1/β-actin): 0.052±0.038 vs. 0.082±0.008, HMGB1 positive expression (A value): 24.530±9.317 vs. 41.830±2.458, both P < 0.01]. In Nrf2-KO mice, compared with CLP group, there was no statistical difference in the above indexes in CLP+H2 group [HO-1 protein expression (HO-1/β-actin): 0.148±0.004 vs. 0.164±0.043, HO-1 positive expression (A value): 0.109±0.020 vs. 0.113±0.025, HMGB1 protein expression (HMGB1/β-actin): 0.109±0.020 vs. 0.113±0.025, HMGB1 positive expression (A value): 39.570±12.660 vs. 42.790±9.680, all P > 0.05]. Conclusions: H2 can inhibit the intestinal injury of mice with severe sepsis through Nrf2/HO-1/HMGB1 pathway, and Nrf2 plays an important role in the treatment of intestinal injury with H2.

Damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been proved to be one of the important causes of SAE. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is a promising method for the treatment of SAE, yet the underlying mechanism is not clear. This study was designed to demonstrate whether H2 can alleviate SAE by protecting the BBB, and whether it is protected by Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream signaling pathways. Either a sham or a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) procedure was applied to female wild-type (WT) and Nrf2-knock-out (Nrf2-/-) C57BL/6J mice. H2 (2%) was given for 60 min starting at 1 h and 6 h after the sham or CLP procedure. In addition, bEnd.3 cells cultured with medium which contained LPS, Saline, DMSO or ML385 (a Nrf2 inhibitor) were also used in the research. The 7-day survival rates were recorded. The Morris water maze was used to determine cognitive function. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), HMGB1, and IL-10), antioxidant enzymes, and oxidation products [superoxide dismutase (SOD), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and (8-iso-PGF2α)] were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Brain water content, Dextran tracer, and Evans blue extravasation were used to detect the damage of the BBB. Western blot analysis was used to detect β-catenin, phosphorylated β-catenin, adhesion-linked protein VE-cadherin, and associated tight junction protein ZO-1. We found that H2 can improve survival in septic mice, decrease escape latency and platform crossing times, decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative product levels in the mouse cortex, and increase the expression of anti-inflammatory factors in WT, but not Nrf2-/-, mice. Moreover, H2 can also decrease brain water content, extravascular dextran, extravascular Evans blue dye, and β-catenin level, and increase ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expressions in WT mice, but not in Nrf2-/- mice. Our result shows that H2 can protect the BBB by decreasing its permeability, thereby reducing SAE and improving cognitive function, which is mediated through Nrf2 and its downstream signaling pathways.

In this randomized controlled cross-over pilot trial, we compared acute effects of single-dose hydrogen-rich water (HRW) and caffeine on estimates by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for alertness and on Attention Network Test (ANT) subscales in 23 young healthy men and women (21.6 ± 1.3 years) who were sleep-deprived for 24 hours. Caffeine induced a significant increase in VAS-estimated alertness (1.6 points, P = 0.01); HRW also increased VAS alertness for 1.7 points on average (P = 0.003). Both caffeine and HRW acutely affected markers of alertness in young sleep-deprived men and women. Caffeine induced a significant drop in alerting (19.9%, P = 0.01) and executive control in a 15-min follow up (7.3%, P = 0.03), while HRW caused a significant reduction in the orientation at post-administration (2.4%, P = 0.05). However, no differences were found between interventions (treatment vs. time interaction) for all evaluated outcomes of alertness (P > 0.05), with the effects similar among interventions. HRW displayed no side effects and, therefore, might be advanced as a safe and effective alternative to caffeine for sleep deprivation, although more studies are needed to corroborate and expand these preliminary findings.",Positive,Human,Brain,Sleep Deprivation,Fatigue,Water (Mg-Chemico),Alkaline,Ingestion,Caffeine,,Serbia

To date, therapies to treat any forms of TBI are still limited. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential neuroprotective effects of molecular hydrogen on TBI. Although it has been demonstrated that hydrogen inhalation (HI) for about 5 hrs immediately after TBI has a beneficial effect on brain injury, the most effective intervention procedure in the treatment of TBI remains unknown. The mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of HI on TBI also needs to be further investigated. Our results showed that inhalation of 4% hydrogen during the first day after TBI was the most effective hydrogen intervention procedure in the treatment of TBI. Pathological examination showed that HI could attenuate TBI-induced reactive astrocytosis and microglial activation. Nissl staining demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of nissl-stained dark neurons (N-DNs) in HI group compared to TBI group at 2 h post-TBI, and the TBI-induced neuronal loss was attenuated by HI at day 3 post-TBI. IHC staining showed that HI resulted a decrease in CD16-positive cells and a further increase in CD206-positive cells as compared to TBI group. Multiplex cytokine assay demonstrated the most profound regulatory effects induced by HI on the levels of IL-12, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF at 24 h post-TBI, which confirmed the inhibitory effect of hydrogen on microglia activation. We concluded that inhalation of 4% hydrogen during the first day after TBI was the most effective intervention procedure in the treatment of TBI.

TMT can induce significant neurodegeneration in the limbic system, particular in hippocampus. However, the molecular mechanisms in TMT-induced learning and memory impairment are not fully clear. Thus, this research was to explore the role of Synaptophysin (SYP) and Ubiquitin-ligating enzyme Siah-1 in TMT-induced nerve impairment and the protective effect of hydrogen rich water (HRW). Methods: Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group (saline, 4 ml/d, i.p.for seven days), HRW group (4 ml/d, i.p.for seven days) , TMT group (2.25mg/kg, i.p. at the seventh day ), and HRW plus TMT group. The spatial learning and memory was tested by Morris water maze, the protein level of SYP and Siah-1were determined by western blot& immunocytochemical analysis, and the tin contents were detected by ICP-MS. Results: The TMT-treated mice showed significant learning and memory disability. Moreover, TMT increased the level of Siah-1, reduced the expression of SYP in hippocampus and cortex. After 7 days of continuous pretreatment with HRW, the mice showed better memory ability, the expression of Siah-1 and tin content decreased accompanied with the increase of SYP. Conclusions: These results showed that HRW ameliorated the decrease of SYP and the nerve impairment induced by TMT, reduced tin content and up-regulated the expressions of Siah-1, and it might be an important role in the protection of neurodegenerative diseases induced by TMT.",Positive,Mouse,Brain,Environmental Pollution,Pesticide Toxicity (Trimethyltin),Water (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome serves a key role in inflammatory response, which may lead to endothelial cell injury and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Hydrogen (H2) is considered a neuroprotective antioxidant. This study was set out to explore whether hydrogen inhalation protects against SAH induced endothelial cell injury, BBB disruption, microthrombosis and vasospasm in rats. Methods: One hundred eighty-two male SD rats were used for the study. SAH was induced by endovascular perforation. H2 at a concentration of 3.3% was inhaled beginning at 0.5 h after SAH for duration of 30, 60 or 120 min, followed by single administration or once daily administration for 3 days. The temporal expression of NLRP3 and ASC in the brain was determined, with the effect of hydrogen inhalation evaluated. In addition, brain water content, oxidative stress markers, inflammasome, apoptotic markers, microthrombosis, and vasospasm were evaluated at 24 or 72 h after SAH. Results: The expression of NLRP3 and ASC were upregulated after SAH associated with elevated expression of MDA, 8-OHdG, 4-HNE, HO-1, TLR4/NF-κB, inflammatory and apoptotic makers. Hydrogen inhalation reduced the expression of these inflammatory and apoptotic makers in the vessels, brain edema, microthrombi formation, and vasospasm in rats with SAH relative to control. Hydrogen inhalation also improved short-term and long-term neurological recovery after SAH. Conclusion: Hydrogen inhalation can ameliorate oxidative stress related endothelial cells injury in the brain and improve neurobehavioral outcomes in rats following SAH. Mechanistically, the above beneficial effects might be related to, at least in part, the inhibition of activation of ROS/NLRP3 axis.",Positive,Rat,Brain,Brain Injury,Intracranial Hemorrhage,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,China

Hydrogen has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent to alleviate SAE. The mechanism, however, remains unclear. This research aimed to determine whether hydrogen alleviates SAE by regulating microglia polarization and whether it is mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-autophagy pathway. Septic models were established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) performed on mice. The Morris Water Maze was used to evaluate cognitive function. M1/M2 microglia polarization was assessed by immunofluorescence. Inflammatory cytokines were determined by ELISA. Septic cell models were established using BV-2 cells incubated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). M1/M2 microglia polarization was assessed by flow cytometry. Inflammatory cytokines from culture medium supernatant were determined by ELISA, and associated protein expression levels of mTOR-autophagy pathway were assessed by Western blot. Hydrogen inhalation attenuated sepsis-induced cognitive impairment with improved escape latency, time spent in the target platform quadrant and number of times crossing the target platform. In both animal and cell research, hydrogen reduced TNF-α, IL-6 and HMGB1 levels and M1 polarization, but increased IL-10 and TGF-β levels and M2 polarization. Hydrogen treatment decreased the ratio of p-mTOR/mTOR and the expression of p62 and increased the ratio of p-AMPK/AMPK, LC3II/LC3I and the expression of TREM-2 and Beclin-1 in LPS-treated BV-2 cells.

As hydrogen gas was recently reported to activate PGC‑1α, the present study investigated whether it restores exhausted CD8+ T cells to improve prognosis in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. A total of 55 patients with histologically and clinically diagnosed stage IV colorectal carcinoma were enrolled between July 2014 and July 2017. The patients inhaled hydrogen gas for 3 h/day at their own homes and received chemotherapy at the Tamana Regional Health Medical Center (Tamana, Kumamoto, Japan). The CD8+ T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood and their phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry. It was found that exhausted terminal programmed cell death 1 (PD‑1)+ CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood are independently associated with worse progression‑free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Notably, hydrogen gas decreased the abundance of exhausted terminal PD‑1+ CD8+ T cells, increased that of active terminal PD‑1‑ CD8+ T cells, and improved PFS and OS times, suggesting that the balance between terminal PD1+ and PD1‑ CD8+ T cells is critical for cancer prognosis. Therefore, a novel system for patient classification (category 1‑4) was developed in the present study based on these two indices to assist in predicting the prognosis and therapeutic response. Collectively, the present results suggested that hydrogen gas reverses imbalances toward PD‑1+ CD8+ T cells to provide an improved prognosis.",Positive,Human,Intestine,Cancer,Immune Dysfunction,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,Japan

The purpose of this study is whether the dissolved hydrogen in hydrogen-rich water was kept even after boiling, and whether hydrogen-bath utilization improves cosmetic effects such as skin-blotch repression and the visceral-fat-based slimming effects. The subjects were two men and two women, aged 48, 43, 42, and 41 years (n = 4). They took warm (41°C) water bath of dissolved hydrogen 300-310 μg/L (< 10 μg/L for normal water) for 10-minute once daily for 1-6 months, followed by examination of skin blotch, visceral fat, and cholesterol and glucose metabolisms. The dissolved hydrogen concentration was measured after 15-minute boiling and the subsequent cooling naturally. The wide-ranging, dense, and irregularly shaped skin blotches became markedly smaller and thinner, assumedly through reductive bleaching of melanin and lipofuscin and promotion of dermal cell renewal by the hydrogen-rich warm water. Ultrasonic resonance-based analysis on the abdominal cross-section revealed that the visceral fat area decreased from 47 to 36 cm[2], and the abdominal circumference decreased from 91 to 82 cm, in the two female subjects bathing in hydrogen-water.

Moreover, we tested if the co-treatment with an electrolyzed reduced (ERW) was effective to protect against alterations induced by PERM. Rats (from postnatal day 6 to 21) were gavaged daily with PERM, PERM+ERW or vehicle and gut, liver and feces were analyzed in 2-months-old rats. Increased gut permeability, measured by FITC-dextran assay, was detected in PERM group compared to control and PERM+ERW groups. In duodenum and ileum, concentration of occludin was higher in control group than those measured in PERM group, whereas only in duodenum ZO-1 was higher in control than those measured in PERM and PERM+ERW groups. Number of inflammatory focis and neutrophils as well as iNOS protein levels were higher in livers of PERM-treated rats than in those of PERM+ERW and control rats. Fecal microbiota analysis revealed that Lachnospira was less abundant and Defluviitaleaceae more abundant in the PERM group, whereas the co-treatment with ERW was protective against PERM treatment since the abundances in Lachnospira and Defluviitaleaceae were similar to those in the control group. Higher abundances of butyrate- producing bacteria such as Blautia, U.m. of Lachnospiraceae family, U.m. of Ruminococcaceae family, Papillibacter, Roseburia, Intestinimonas, Shuttleworthia together with higher butyric acid levels were detected in PERM+ERW group compared to the other groups. In conclusion, the PD animal model showed increased intestinal permeability together with hepatic inflammation correlated with altered gut microbiota.

Human studies in Asia have established the safety of hydrogen gas in the treatment of hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and cardiac diseases. Mechanistically, hydrogen gas has been shown to affect oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. We hypothesized that hydrogen therapy would improve neurological function and increase survival rate in SAH. High dose hydrogen gas (66% at 3 L/min) was administered for 2 hours at 0.5, 8, and 18 hours after SAH. This treatment increased 72-hour survival rate and provided 24-hour neuroprotection after SAH in rats. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that high dose hydrogen gas therapy reduces mortality and improves outcome after SAH. Our results correlate well with the proposed mechanisms of hydrogen gas therapy within the literature. We outline four pathways and downstream targets of hydrogen gas potentially responsible for our results. A potentially complex network of pathways responsible for the efficacy of hydrogen gas therapy, along with a limited mechanistic understanding of these pathways, justifies further investigation to provide a basis for clinical trials and the advancement of hydrogen gas therapy in humans.

The cells produce free radicals to help to absorb nutritious substances due to metabolism, which is a unique phenomenon for biological organisms. But if over the tension of free radicals can seriously affect the physiological functions, and even lead to death. Recently, scientists found that molecular hydrogen is a free radicals scavenger. However, no bio physiological mechanism and experiment have shown that by drinking hydrogen water, can eliminate the free radicals in animals and the evidence sufficient to influence the survival rate after fasting. Surprisingly, the results of the study support that hydrogen water may be helpful for the survival rate of the fasted fly. When the body loses oxygen free radicals due to food breakoff, hydrogen water may neutralize free radicals and reduce damage to cells. However, we also found that hydrogen water seems to be much help for relatively weak individuals, such as the mutant flies, and it is also favorable for individuals with stronger physique in wild Drosophila melanogaster females.

However, the early prognostic accuracy of EEG may be affected by postresuscitation interventions. Recent animal studies found that hydrogen inhalation after CA greatly improved neurological outcomes by selectively neutralizing highly reactive oxidants, but the effect of hydrogen inhalation on EEG recovery and its prognostication value are still unclear. The present study investigated the effects of hydrogen inhalation on early postresuscitation EEG characteristics in an asphyxial CA rat model. Methods: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated after 5 min of untreated CA in 40 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were randomized for ventilation with 98% oxygen plus 2% hydrogen (H2) or 98% oxygen plus 2% nitrogen (Ctrl) under normothermia for 1 h. EEG characteristics were continuously recorded for 4 h, and the relationships between quantitative EEG characteristics and 96 h neurological outcomes were investigated. Results: No differences in baseline and resuscitation data were observed between groups, but the survival rate was significantly higher in the H2 group than in the Ctrl group (90% vs. 40%, P < 0.01). Compared to the Ctrl group, the H2 group showed a shorter burst onset time (21.85 [20.00-23.38] vs. 25.70 [22.48-30.05], P < 0.01) and time to normal trace (169.83 [161.63-208.55] vs. 208.39 [186.29-248.80], P < 0.01).

Therefore, we focused on the mechanism and role of autophagy and inflammasome, by which hydrogen alleviated the hyperpathia induced by neuropathic pain. The results showed that neuropathic pain stimulated activation of inflammasome NLRP3 and autophagy pathway in the microglial cells of the spinal cord. The inhibition of NLRP3 inhibited the hyperpathia induced by spinal nerve litigation surgery. The absence of autophagy aggravated the inflammasome activity and hyperpathia.

Although much progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of sepsis, further discussion and study of the detailed therapeutic mechanisms are needed. Autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress are two pathways of the complicated regulatory network of sepsis. Herein, we focus on the cellular mechanism in which autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress participate in hydrogen (H2)-protected sepsis-induced organ injury. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the following groups: control group, cecal ligation puncture (CLP) group, CLP + tunicamycin(TM) group, CLP + 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) group, CLP + rapamycin (Rap) group, CLP + 3-methyladenine (3-MA) group, CLP + H2 group, CLP + H2 + 3-MA group, and CLP + H2 + TM group.

Results: We demonstrated that sepsis induced endoplasmic reticulum stress. Moreover, it was found that an increase in endoplasmic reticulum impaired autophagy activity in sepsis, and the absence of endoplasmic reticulum stress attenuated tissue histological injury and dysfunction of lung, liver, and kidney in septic mice. Intriguingly, hydrogen alleviated the endoplasmic reticulum stress via the autophagy pathway and also mitigated inflammation and organ injury.

The results demonstrated that LPS and ATP led to NLRP3 inflammasome pathway activation, excessive cytokine release, mitochondrial dysfunction and the activation of autophagy. CLP induced organ injury and NLRP3 pathway activation. H2 treatment ameliorated vital organ damage, the inflammatory response, mitochondrial dysfunction and NLRP3 pathway activation, and promoted autophagy in macrophages induced by LPS and in CLP mice. However, the inhibitor of autophagy and the inducer of NLRP3 reversed the protective effect of H2 against organ damage, the inflammatory response and mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo and in vitro.

Hydrogen exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that may be exploited to control cancer, the occurrence and progression of which is closely related to peroxidation and inflammation. We conducted a prospective follow-up study of 82 patients with stage III and IV cancer treated with hydrogen inhalation using the 'real world evidence' method. After 3-46 months of follow-up, 12 patients died in stage IV. After 4 weeks of hydrogen inhalation, patients reported significant improvements in fatigue, insomnia, anorexia and pain. Furthermore, 41.5% of patients had improved physical status, with the best effect achieved in lung cancer patients and the poorest in patients with pancreatic and gynecologic cancers. Of the 58 cases with one or more abnormal tumor markers elevated, the markers were decreased at 13-45 days (median 23 days) after hydrogen inhalation in 36.2%. The greatest marker decrease was in achieved lung cancer and the lowest in pancreatic and hepatic malignancies.

Unfortunately, it remains unclear whether the texture or physical properties of dentin are affected by the application of electrolyzed water of different acidities. This study was aimed to assess the influence of electrolyzed waters with differing pHs on the demineralizing of inner dentin. Materials and methods: The coronal superficial dentin of 20 human molars was exposed and further bisected into two pieces perpendicular to the dentin surface. The samples were immersed in strongly acidic electrolyzed water (AW group), neutral electrolyzed water (NW group), 5% sodium hypochlorite (positive control, NL group), or deionized water (negative control, DW group). Microhardness of the inner layer dentin was measured at a depth of 25 and 50 μm beneath the superficial surface layer every 5 up to 60 min. Results: At a depth of 25 μm, microhardness decreased with increasing immersion time in all but the DW group. The AW group exhibited a decreasing trend from the first 5 min that became significant after 35 min of immersion and was the most rapid decrease in the four groups. The rate of decline in the NW group was low and similar to that of the NL group. Both NW and NL groups exhibited significantly less demineralization than the AW group after 15 min of immersion.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the protective effects of hydrogen on stroke-induced ischemia–reperfusion injury and its detailed mechanism. Two weeks after the inhalation of high concentrations (66.7%) of hydrogen, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced in mice using the thread occlusion technique to establish an animal model of the focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. Then, a metabolomics analysis of mouse cerebral cortex tissues was first performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) to study the metabolic changes and protective mechanisms of hydrogen on stroke ischemia–reperfusion injury. According to the metabolomic profiling of cortex tissues, 29 different endogenous metabolites were screened, including palmitoyl-l-carnitine, citric acid, glutathione, taurine, acetyl-l-carnitine, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid (NAAG), l-aspartic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE). Through pathway analysis, the metabolic pathways were concentrate on the glutathione pathway and the taurine pathway, mitochondrial energy metabolism and phospholipid metabolism that related to the oxidative stress process.

Hydrogen-rich saline (HS) treatment in neonatal mice has been reported to alleviate brain injury following HI, but the mechanisms involved are not known. Methods A modified version of the Rice-Vannucci method for the induction of neonatal HI brain injury was performed on postnatal day 7 mouse pups. Animals or BV2-cells received HS and an AMPK inhibitor at indicative time post-injury. Results In the current study, we show that HS treatment attenuated the accumulation of CD11b⁺/CD45high cells, suppressed HI-induced neuro-inflammation, induced microglial anti-inflammatory M2 polarization, was associated with promoting AMPK activation, and inhibited nuclear factor-κB activation as demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, HS treatment reversed HI-induced neurological disabilities, was associated with improving damaged synapses, and restored the expression levels of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 following HI insult. Furthermore, HI insult which increased levels of complement component C1q, C3, and C3aR1 was observed. Importantly, C1q deposited in the infarct core and lesion boundary zone following HI injury, was found to co-localize within regions of synapse loss, whereas HS treatment reversed these effects of HI on synapse loss and complement component levels. Notably, the AMPK inhibitor reversed the beneficial effects of HS as described above. Conclusions These results demonstrate that HS restored behavioral deficits after HI in neonatal mice. These beneficial effects, in part, involve promoting microglia M2 polarization and complement-mediated synapse loss via AMPK activation.

In the other four groups, an intestinal IRI was performed for 45 min by clamping the superior mesenteric artery. After intestinal IRI, anastomosis was performed by cutting the intestine from the proximal 15 cm of the ileocecal valve at the first and 24th hours. HRSS was given intraperitoneally 5 ml/kg before reperfusion and for four more days in the HRSS¹ and HRSS²⁴groups, while no treatment was given to the I/R¹ and I/R²⁴ groups. After 5 days, all groups underwent relaparotomy. The anastomotic bursting pressures were measured in all groups, except the Sham group. The tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in the tissues taken from the anastomosis line. The tissue sections were evaluated histopathologically and the apoptosis index was determined by applying the TUNEL method. The results were analyzed one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson's chi-squared test. Results Although the MPO, MDA, IL-6 and TNF-α tissue values were not statistically significant among the groups, the degree of tissue damage and apoptosis levels were lower and the anastomotic bursting pressures values were higher in the HRSS¹ and HRSS²⁴ groups compared to the I/R¹ and I/R²⁴ groups. Conclusion HRSS is effective in reducing the intestinal damage caused by an IRI: HRSS has the potential to reduce the detrimental effects of intestinal anastomosis performed after an intestinal IRI.",Positive,Rat,Intestine,Surgery/Transplantation,Anastomosis,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,Turkey

Here, targeting gastric cancer, a 2D magnesium boride nanosheet (MBN) is synthesized as a new type of acid‐responsive hydrogen‐releasing prodrug by an ultrasound‐assisted chemical etching route, which is used to realize hydrogenochemotherapy by combination of facile oral administration of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)‐encapsulating MBN (MBN@PVP) pills with routine intravenous injection of doxorubicin (DOX). The MBN@PVP pill has high stability in normal tissues/blood environments as well as high gastric acid‐responsiveness with sustained release behavior, which matches well with its metabolism rate in the stomach in great favor of continuous and long‐term hydrogen administration. Hydrogenochemotherapy with DOX+MBN@PVP has remarkably prolonged the survival time of gastric tumor‐bearing mice by reducing the toxic side effects of chemotherapy. The mechanism for therapeutic synergy and side effect attenuation of hydrogenochemotherapy is discovered to be derived from the selectivity of hydrogen molecules in inhibiting aerobic respiration of gastric cells but activating aerobic respiration of normal cells including marrow mesenchymal stem cells and cardiac, hepatic, and splenic cells.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is involved in the molecular mechanisms of prooxidative and pro-inflammatory effect of PM2.5. Molecular hydrogen has antioxidant properties. The protective effect and mechanism of hydrogen on PM2.5-induced lung injury remain unclear. Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether hydrogen could alleviate lung injury in a rat model of subacute exposure to concentrated ambient PM2.5, and explore the mechanism related to AhR. Methods: Male Wastar rats were exposed to either concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) (diameter: ≤2.5 μm, average concentration: 1328 ± 730 μg/m3) or filtered air (FA) by nose-only inhalation (5 h/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks). Hydrogen-treated rats inhaled 66.7% hydrogen from water electrolysis for 2 h after each exposure to CAPs or FA. Results: CAPs inhalation induced lung injury, as demonstrated by pulmonary function decrease, histopathological damage, mucus hypersecretion [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining for mucins, immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) for mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) expression], increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-1β) and oxidative damage indexes [malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-isoprostane F2α (8-iso-PG)]. While, hydrogen inhalation significantly alleviated the damages mentioned above. In addition, low expression of AhR in lung tissues determined by Western Blot was found after CAPs exposure, whereas hydrogen inhibited AhR decline induced by CAPs. Conclusions: High concentrations of hydrogen could ameliorate pulmonary dysfunction, airway mucus hypersecretion, oxidation damage, and inflammation response in rats exposed to concentrated ambient PM2.5. Additionally, hydrogen alleviates lung injury induced by PM2.5 possibly through AhR-dependent mechanisms.

The aim was to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of H2 on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. • What are the main findings and its importance? Our results indicate that, in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, H2 inhalation could attenuate oxidative stress and reversed the formation of pulmonary EMT process by reducing ROS production and inhibiting the expression of TGF-β1, α-SMA and collagen I to improve fibrotic injury and exert anti-fibrogenic effects. Thus, H2 inhalation represents promising therapeutic potential as a useful adjuvant treatment for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that deserves further study and evaluation. Abstract: Background Hydrogen (H2 ) can protect against tissue damage. The effect of H2 inhalation therapy on the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis remains unknown. This study was to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of H2 inhalation on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Material and Methods Pulmonary fibrosis rat models were established by BLM. Rats were randomly divided into the control and H2 inhalation groups. The H&E and Mason's staining were performed to evaluate pulmonary fibrosis injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, structural disorder and collagen deposition. qRT-PCR and western blot assays were used to determine the expression of TNF-α, TGF-β1, α-SMA, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, VEGF and collagen type I at both mRNA and protein levels. The contents of ROS, TGF-β1, TNF-α, MDA and hydroxyproline were determined by biochemical test kits or ELISA kits. Results BLM-stimulated rats exhibited typical symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis which featured as: increased collagen deposition, alveolitis, fibrosis and the parenchymal structural disorder in the lung. However, BLM-induced oxidative stress could be attenuated by H2 inhalation therapy through reducing the contents of ROS, MDA and hydroxyproline, enhancing the activity of glutathione peroxidase and decreasing the expression of TGF-β1 and TNF-α. In addition, H2 inhalation also inhibited BLM-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) by inhibiting TGF-β1 to increase the expression level of epithelial cell marker E-cadherin while decrease the expression level of mesenchymal cell marker vimentin in a time-dependent manner. In addition, H2 inhalation down-regulated α-SMA expression and suppressed collagen I generation to exert anti-fibrogenic effects.

We found that CIH-induced renal iron overloaded along with increased apoptosis and oxidative stress. Iron accumulates mainly occurred in the proximal tubule epithelial cells of rats as showed by Perl’s stain. Moreover, we found that CIH could promote renal transferrin receptor and divalent metal transporter-1 expression, inhibit ceruloplasmin expression.

However, molecular mechanism underlying the potential effect of H2 on chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) induced renal injury remains obscure. Materials and methods In the present study, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into four groups: control (CON) group, CIH group, CIH with H2 treatment (CIH + H2) group, and control with H2 treatment (CON + H2) group. Oxidative stress, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were detected to determine how H2 affected the renal function of CIH exposed rats. Key findings We demonstrated that rats who inhale hydrogen gas showed improved renal function, alleviated pathological damage, oxidative stress and apoptosis in CIH rats. Meanwhile, CIH-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress was decreased by H2 as the expressions of CHOP, caspase-12, and GRP78 were down-regulated. Furthermore, relative higher levels of LC3-II/I ratio and Beclin-1, with decreased expression of p62, were found after H2 administrated. Inhibition of mTOR may be involved in the upregulation of autophagy by H2. Finally, increased phosphorylation of p38 and JNK was involved in the CIH-induced pathological process. H2 could inhibit the activation of p38 and JNK, suggesting H2 played an active part in resisting renal injury via MAPK. Significance Taken together, our study reveals that H2 can ameliorate CIH-induced kidney injury by decreasing endoplasmic reticulum stress and activating autophagy through inhibiting oxidative stress-dependent p38 and JNK MAPK activation.",Positive,Rat,Kidney,Sleep Apnea,Hypoxia-Ischemia,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,China

This study aimed to investigate the effect of hydrogen (H2 ) gas on hypertension induced by intermittent hypoxia in rats. The adult rats were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) 8 hours/day for 5 weeks and/or H 2 gas 2 hours/day. We found that the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) increased significantly in rats exposed to intermittent hypoxia, both of which were markedly attenuated after H treatment. Furthermore, intermittent hypoxia exposure elevated renal sympathetic nerve activity, consistent with plasma norepinephrine. Additionally, H 2 gas significantly improved CIH-induced abnormal vascular relaxation. Nevertheless, inhalation of H 2 gas alone did not cause such changes. Moreover, H 2 gas-treated rats exposed to CIH showed a significant reduction in 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine content and increases in superoxide dismutase activity, indicating improved oxidative stress. Taken together, these results indicate that H 2 gas has significant effects on the reduction of BP without any side effects.

In this study, we explore whether H2 improves the preservation effect of osteochondral allograft by adding it to Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) solution during the tissue culture stage. The osteochondral allograft apparatus was used to harvest 60 pieces of cylindrical allografts (l = 10 mm, d = 6 mm) cartilage in the lateral loading area of the femoral condyle from the pig knee joint in the aseptic condition, and the grafts were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control group (DMEM solution without hydrogen); H-1 group (DMEM solution with hydrogen concentration of 0.2 mmol/L); H-2 group (DMEM solution with hydrogen concentration of 0.4 mmol/L); and H-3 group (DMEM solution with hydrogen concentration of 0.8 mmol/L).

It has been reported to have protective effects on tissue ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injuries in animal models. The protective mechanism of hydrogen molecules is based on selectively reducing highly strong oxidants in cells, thereby reducing inflammation and decreasing the contents of MDA, FOXO3a, and other pathways that result in flap necrosis. Previous studies were conducted with postconditioning with hydrogen. In this article, we want to investigate whether inhalation of hydrogen has a preventive effect on IR injury. Methods: Forty-five adult male Sprague Dawley rats (body weight 220-250 g) were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Sham operation group (SH), (2) Ischemia-reperfusion injury group (IR), and (3) Ischemia-reperfusion injury with preconditioning hydrogen group (PRH). IR injury was induced by clamping the right superficial epigastric artery for 3 h. Before undergoing 3 h of IR management, the PRH group was treated with hydrogen inhalation for 1 h. On the third postoperative day, survival area and blood perfusion of the flap were assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry. RIP1 and RIP3 were examined by immunological detection and western blot analysis. Results: Both the IR and PRH groups had less skin flap survival area and less blood perfusion than the sham group (P < 0.05). RIP1 and RIP3 were highly expressed in the IR and PRH groups when compared with those in the SH group (P < 0.05).

Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for cancer patients has been recently performed to alleviate the adverse effects, but reducing bone marrow damage is limited in the patients with multiple tumor lesions and large irradiation volume. Molecular hydrogen (H2) was recently reported as a preventive and therapeutic antioxidant that selectively scavenges hydroxy radical (*OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-). This observational study aims to examine whether H2 gas treatment improves IMRT radiation-induced bone marrow damage in cancer patients. Methods: The patients with end stage of cancer were received IMRT once per day for 1 to 4 weeks except Saturday and Sunday. After each IMRT, the patients of control group (n = 7) were housed in health care chamber (HCC, mild hyperbaric oxygen chamber) for 30 minutes, and the patients of H2 group (n = 16) were also housed in HCC and received 5% H2 gas for 30 minutes once per day. Radiation-induced bone marrow damage was evaluated by hematological examination of peripheral blood obtained before and after IMRT. Results: IMRT with HCC therapy significantly reduced white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (PLT) respectively, but not red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB) and hematocrit (HT). In contrast, H2 gas treatment significantly alleviates reducing effects of WBC and PLT respectively. There was no difference in anti-tumor effects between the two groups. Interpretation: Our study demonstrated that H2 gas inhalation therapy significantly alleviates IMRT radiation-induced bone marrow damage without compromising anti-tumor effects. These results suggest that H2 gas treatment would be a strategy for reducing IMRT bone marrow damage in cancer patients.",Positive,Human,Bone Marrow,Cancer,Radioprotection,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,Japan

The benefits of hydrogen water on motor deficits have been reported in animal PD models and PD patients, but the effects of hydrogen gas on PD patients have not been studied. We evaluated the effect of inhalation of hydrogen gas on olfactory function, non-motor symptoms, activities of daily living, and urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG) levels by a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with an 8-week washout period in 20 patients with PD. Patients inhaled either ~1.2-1.4% hydrogen-air mixture or placebo for 10 minutes twice a day for 4 weeks. Inhalation of low dose hydrogen did not significantly influence the PD clinical parameters, but it did increase urinary 8-OHdG levels by 16%. This increase in 8-OHdG is markedly less than the over 300% increase in diabetes, and is more comparable to the increase after a bout of strenuous exercise. Although increased reactive oxygen species is often associated with toxicity and disease, they also play essential roles in mediating cytoprotective cellular adaptations in a process known as hormesis. Increases of oxidative stress by hydrogen have been previously reported, along with its ability to activate the Nrf2, NF-κB pathways, and heat shock responses. Although we did not observe any beneficial effect of hydrogen in our short trial, we propose that the increased 8-OHdG and other reported stress responses from hydrogen may indicate that its beneficial effects are partly or largely mediated by hormetic mechanisms. The study was approved by the ethics review committee of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine (approval number 2015-0295).

Piglets were divided into three groups: hypoxic-ischaemic insult with normothermia (NT), insult with hypothermia (TH, 33.5 ± 0.5 °C), and insult with hypothermia with H2 ventilation (TH-H2, 2.1-2.7%).

Most piglets in the TH-H2 group could walk at day 3 of recovery, whereas walking ability was delayed in the two other groups. The histological results revealed that TH-H2 tended to improve the status of cortical gray matter and subcortical white matter, with a considerable reduction in cell death.

The rat model of acute liver injury induced by AFB1 was established by single intragastric administration of AFB1 (2.0 mg/kg), and then the rats were treated with hydrogen-enriched water intragastrically. HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes of liver tissue. Blood samples were taken from vena cava to measure serum liver function indexes. Live tissue was sampled to detect malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) contents. Western blot was used to detect phosphorylation levels of MAPK signaling pathway proteins (ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK). The results showed that, compared with the AFB1 group, the AFB1+H2 group exhibited increased body weights, alleviated acute liver injury, decreased activities of serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, as well as total bilirubin level in the serum. Meanwhile, hydrogen-enriched water decreased MDA content and increased GSH content in liver tissue. AFB1-increased phosphorylation levels of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK in liver tissue were down-regulated significantly by hydrogen-enriched water treatment.

Previous studies have demonstrated that hydrogen protects brain after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) by inhibiting inflammation, but the specific mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect of hydrogen is poorly understood. The goal of our study is to investigate whether inhalation of high concentration hydrogen (HCH) is able to attenuate I/R-induced microglia activation. Eighty C57B/L male mice were divided into four groups: sham, I/R, I/R + HCH and I/R + N2/O2 groups. Assessment of animals happened in 'blind' matter. I/R was induced by occlusion of middle cerebral artery for one hour). After one hour, filament was withdrawn, which induced reperfusion. Hydrogen treated I/R animals inhaled mix of 66.7% H2 balanced with O2 for 90 minutes, starting immediately after initiation of reperfusion. Control animals (N2/O2) inhaled mix in which hydrogen was replaced with N2 for the same time (90 minutes). The brain injury, such as brain infarction and development of brain edema, as well as neurobehavioral deficits were determined 23 hours after reperfusion. Effect of HCH on microglia activation in the ischemic penumbra was investigated by immunostaining also 23 hours after reperfusion. mRNA expression of inflammation related genes was detected by PCR. Our results showed that HCH attenuated brain injury and consequently reduced neurological dysfunction after I/R. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HCH directed microglia polarization towards anti-inflammatory M2 polarization. This study indicates hydrogen may exert neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the microglial activation and regulating microglial polarization.

In asthma, the phagocytic capacity of alveolar macrophages is significantly reduced, which is thought to be associated with increased oxidative stress. Hydrogen (H2) has been shown to exert potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, yet its effects on phagocytosis of alveolar macrophages are unknown. This study is aimed to evaluate the beneficial effects of hydrogen gas inhalation on alveolar macrophage phagocytosis in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine asthma model. Methods: Female C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally sensitized with OVA before they were subject to airway challenge with aerosolized OVA. Hydrogen gas was delivered to the mice through inhalation twice a day (2 h once) for 7 consecutive days. Phagocytic function of alveolar macrophages isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was assessed by fluorescence-labeled Escherichia coli as well as flow cytometry. Results: Alveolar macrophages isolated from OVA-induced asthmatic mice showed decreased phagocytic capacity to Escherichia coli when compared with those of control mice.

Hydrogen gas inhalation significantly alleviated OVA-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia, diminished TH2 response and decreased IL-4 as well as IgE levels, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Concomitantly, hydrogen gas inhalation inhibited NF-κB activation and markedly activated Nrf2 pathway in OVA-induced asthmatic mice. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that hydrogen gas inhalation enhanced alveolar macrophage phagocytosis in OVA-induced asthmatic mice, which may be associated with the antioxidant effects of hydrogen gas and the activation of the Nrf2 pathway.",Positive,Mouse,Lung,Asthma,Oxidative Stress,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,China

Ultrasound oscillation in an aqueous solution produces ·OH. Our recent study demonstrated that H2 dissolved in an irrigation solution prevented corneal endothelial damage during phacoemulsification in an animal model. We examined the effects of H2 during clinical phacoemulsification. Design: A single-center, prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial. Methods: Thirty-two patients who had cataracts of similar nucleus hardness in both eyes (age: 75.4±7.68 years; 17 males, 15 females) were recruited. Phacoemulsification was performed using a solution of dissolved H2 in one eye, and a conventional solution in the contralateral eye. Endothelial cell density (ECD) at the center of the cornea was measured using noncontact specular microscopy preoperatively and at 1 day, 1 week, and 3 weeks postoperatively. Results: Reduction rates of ECD (mean ± standard deviation) were 16.0%±15.7% at 1 day, 15.4%±16.1% at 1 week, and 18.4%±14.9% at 3 weeks in the control group, compared to 6.5%±8.7% at 1 day (P = .003), 9.3%±11.0% at 1 week (P = .039), and 8.5%±10.5% at 3 weeks (P = .004) in the H2 groups. These rates were significantly smaller in the H2 group at all time points. Conclusions: H2 dissolved in irrigation solution reduced corneal endothelial damage during phacoemulsification. This suggests that a considerable part of the corneal endothelial damage during phacoemulsification is caused by oxidative stress, and that H2 is useful in clinical phacoemulsification.",Positive,Human,Eye,Surgery/Transplantation,Surgical Injury,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Irrigation,,,Japan

In experiment 1, a Fenton reaction with phenylalanine (0 or 1.37 mmol/L of H 2 ) was conducted. In experiment 2, rats received intraperitoneally 400 mg/kg of corn oil containing phorone, 7 days after drinking ad libitum water containing 0 or 4% fructooligosaccharides (groups CP and FP, respectively). In experiment 3, rats unable to synthesise ascorbic acid, drank ad libitum for 14 days, water with 240 mg/L (group AC), 20 mg of ascorbic acid/L (group DC) or 20 mg of ascorbic acid/L and 4% fructooligosaccharides (group DCF). In the Fenton reaction, H 2 reduced tyrosine produced from phenylalanine to 72% when platinum was added and to 92% when platinum was excluded. In experiment 2, liver glutathione was depleted by administration of phorone to rats. However, compared with CP, no change in the m- tyrosine concentration in the liver of FP was detected. In experiment 3, net H 2 excretion was higher in DCF than in the other rats, 3 days after the experiment ended. Furthermore, the concentrations of H 2 and α-tocopherol and the reduction–oxidation glutathione ratio in perirenal adipose tissue of rats were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in DCF than in DC. To summarise, in rat colon, fermentation-derived H 2 further reduced the reduction–oxidation balance in perirenal adipose tissue through increased regeneration of α-tocopherol.",Positive,Rat,Whole Body,ROS-Scavenging,Oxidative Stress,Gas,N/A,In Vivo Biotic Production,,,Japan

Subsequently, extensive studies revealed multiple functions of H2 by exhibiting the efficacies of H2 in various animal models and clinical studies. Here, we investigated the effect of H2 on free-radical-induced cytotoxicity using tert-butyl hydroperoxide in a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. Cell membrane permeability was determined using lactate dehydrogenase release assay and Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide staining. Fatty acid peroxidation and mitochondrial viability were measured using 2 kinds of fluorescent dyes, Liperfluo and C11-BODIPY, and using the alamarBlue assay based on the reduction of resazurin to resorufin by mainly mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase, respectively. Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated using tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester. As a result, H2 protected the cultured cells against the cytotoxic effects induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide; H2 suppressed cellular fatty acid peroxidation and cell membrane permeability, mitigated the decline in mitochondrial oxidoreductase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential, and protected cells against cell death evaluated using propidium iodide staining. These results suggested that H2 suppresses free-radical-induced cell death through protection against fatty acid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Treatment solutions for mild TBI typically concentrate on complete rest, while non-traditional therapeutic options remain largely ineffective. Molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) is an innovative neuroprotective agent that can easily reach the brain, yet no data are available concerning its value as a first-aid intervention after a mild TBI. Case report: This case report demonstrates the efficacy and safety of a hydrogen-producing dissolving tablet administered buccally during the first 24 hours post-injury in a professional soccer player who suffered a mild TBI. The patient received a formulated dosage of hydrogen every 2 hours, with the first intervention given immediately after an initial examination (~ 15 min after the injury). The overall score for Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT2), a standardized method of evaluating injured athletes for concussion, increased from 68 points (severe disruption) at baseline to 84 points (mild disruption) at 24-h follow-up. The patient reported no side effects of hydrogen intervention.

All participants (age 22.9 ± 1.5 years; body mass index 23.4 ± 2.5 kg m-2; 10 women and 10 men) were allocated to receive either gaseous hydrogen (4%) or placebo (room air) by 20-min once-per-day inhalation for 7 days, with a wash-out period of 7 days to prevent the residual effects of interventions across study periods. The primary treatment outcome was the change in running time-to-exhaustion in the incremental maximal test from baseline to day 7. Additionally, assessment of other exercise performance endpoints and clinical chemistry biomarkers was performed at baseline and at 7 days after each intervention. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID NCT03846141).

It is well known that Fusarium mycotoxins will lead a breakdown of the normally impeccable epithelial barrier, resulting in the development of a “leaky” gut. H2 administration with different methods has been proved definitely potentials to prevent serious intestinal diseases. The goal of this study is to investigate the roles of lactulose (LAC) and hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in preventing intestinal dysfunction in piglets fed Fusarium mycotoxin-contaminated feed. Methods A total of 24 female piglets were evenly assigned to 4 groups: negative control (NC) group, mycotoxin-contaminated (MC) feed group, MC feed with LAC treatment (MC + LAC), and MC feed with HRW treatment (MC + HRW), respectively. Piglets in the NC group were fed uncontaminated control diet, while remaining piglets were fed Fusarium mycotoxin-contaminated diet. For the NC and MC groups, 10 mL/kg body weight (BW) of hydrogen-free water (HFW) was orally administrated to piglets twice daily; while in the MC + LAC and MC + HRW groups, piglets were treated with the same dose of LAC solution (500 mg/kg BW) and HRW twice daily, respectively. On d 25, serum was collected and used for biochemical analysis. Intestinal tissues were sampled for morphological examination as well as relative genes and protein expression analysis. Results Our data showed that Fusarium mycotoxins induced higher serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activities (P < 0.05), D-lactic acid levels (P < 0.01), and endotoxin status (P < 0.01), lower villus height (P < 0.01) and ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P < 0.05) in small intestine, greater apoptosis index and higher mRNA expression related to tight junctions (P < 0.05). In addition, the distribution and down-regulation of claudin-3 (CLDN3) protein in the small intestinal was also observed. As expected, oral administrations of HRW and LAC were found to remarkably provide beneficial effects against Fusarium mycotoxin-induced apoptosis and intestinal leaking. Moreover, either HRW or LAC treatments were also revealed to prevent abnormal intestinal morphological changes, disintegrate tight junctions, and restore the expression and distribution of CLDN3 protein in the small intestinal mucosal layer in female piglets that were fed Fusarium mycotoxins contaminated diet. Conclusions Our data suggest that orally administrations of HRW and LAC result in less Fusarium mycotoxin-induced apoptosis and leak in the small intestine. Either HRW or LAC treatments could prevent the abnormal changes of intestinal morphology and molecular response of tight junctions as well as restore the distribution and expression of CLDN3 protein of small intestinal mucosa layer in female piglets that were fed Fusarium mycotoxins contaminated diet.

After 12 h of different treatments, the cell viability, biomarkers of cell redox states, and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and apoptosis were observed and detected. Furthermore, caspase-3 and Bax protein expressions were measured by Western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that the 5 μM DON significantly caused cytotoxicity to IPEC-J2 cells by reducing cell viability and increasing lactate dehydrogenase release in culture supernatants. Moreover, DON treatments significantly increased levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, and malonaldehyde; however, they decreased total superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and downregulated messenger RNA (mRNA) expression related to antioxidant enzymes in cells. The 5 μM DON treatment also downregulated Bcl-2 expression and upregulated caspase-3 and Bax expression. However, the H2-saturated medium significantly improved cell growth status and reversed the change of redox states and expression of genes and proteins related to apoptosis induced by DON in IPEC-J2 cells.

Autophagy, a self-cannibalization mechanism, has been demonstrated to be involved in VD progression. Molecular hydrogen is known for its powerful anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities, and it is also involved in autophagy. However, the effects of hydrogen on VD remain unclear. The current study found that hydrogen-rich water (HRW) significantly alleviated spatial learning and memory impairments. Similar to donepezil treatment, HRW also inhibited neuron loss and shrinkage in the hippocampal CA1 region. In addition, we found that HRW significantly increased the Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio and decreased cleaved caspase-3 expression levels in the hippocampus of VD rats. Moreover, electron microscopy revealed that HRW decreased the number of autophagosomes. We also observed that HRW reduced the increased ratio of LC3-II/I and Beclin 1 expression and saliently upregulated p62 expression. Furthermore, FoxO1 (a major mediator of autophagy regulation) and Atg7 levels were apparently decreased in the hippocampus of HRW-treated bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) rats. Taken together, these data show that molecular hydrogen exerts beneficial effects on cognitive impairment induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. FoxO1-mediated autophagy plays an important role in the neuroprotective effects of hydrogen in a rat model of VD. Furthermore, the present findings highlight that HRW should be further investigated as a new therapeutic strategy for VD treatment in the future.

However, little is known about the effects of H2 on redox biomarkers and related indicators during exercise. Therefore, we examined whether 2 weeks of H2 water intake could affect the redox biomarkers, energy metabolism, and performance level of rats during endurance exercise. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N.=32) were randomly divided into four groups: control (C), control-exercise (C-Ex), H2 water (H2), and H2 water-exercise (H2-Ex). Each group was given mineral water (C and C-Ex) or H2 water (H2 and H2-Ex) ad libitum for 2 weeks. Then the C-Ex and H2-Ex groups were subjected to an exercise performance test. Blood, skeletal muscle, and liver samples were analysed for redox biomarkers, blood energy substrates, and tissue glycogen contents. RESULTS: Two-way ANOVA revealed that H2 water intake did not affect redox biomarkers (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, protein carbonyl, and total antioxidant capacity), blood energy substrates (lactate, glucose, free fatty acid, and triglyceride), and muscle glycogen content. However, liver glycogen content was significantly higher in the H2-Ex group than in the C-Ex group (P < 0.01).

The supplementation with hydrogen-rich food prolonged the life span of the wild-type strain. To gain insights into the effect of hydrogen, we used previously generated mutant under-expressing redox-regulating enzymes, peroxiredoxins, in mitochondria. The hydrogen-releasing material lessened the severe shortening of life span of the mutant. Hydrogen also delayed the development of intestinal dysfunction caused by under-expression of peroxiredoxins in the intestinal epithelium. Hydrogen also averted a significant decrease in the mobility of mutant flies that under-expressed peroxiredoxins globally or in specific tissues.

However, these methods require considerable time and effort for preparation. We investigated a practical technique for rapidly dissolving hydrogen gas in organ preservation solutions by using a canister containing hydrogen-absorbing alloy. The efficacy of hydrogen-containing organ preservation solution created by this method was tested in a miniature pig model of kidney transplantation from donors with circulatory arrest. The time required for dissolution of hydrogen gas was only 2-3 minutes. When hydrogen gas was infused into a bag containing cold ETK organ preservation solution at a pressure of 0.06 MPa and the bag was subsequently opened to the air, the dissolved hydrogen concentration remained at 1.0 mg/L or more for 4 hours. After warm ischemic injury was induced by circulatory arrest for 30 minutes, donor kidneys were harvested and perfused for 5 minutes with hydrogen-containing cold ETK solution or hydrogen-free cold ETK solution. The perfusion rate was faster from the initial stage with hydrogen-containing cold ETK solution than with hydrogen-free ETK solution. After storage of the kidney in hydrogen-free preservation solution for 1 hour before transplantation, no urine production was observed and blood flow was not detected in the transplanted kidney at sacrifice on postoperative day 6. In contrast, after storage in hydrogen-containing preservation solution for either 1 or 4 hours, urine was detected in the bladder and blood flow was confirmed in the transplanted kidney. This method of dissolving hydrogen gas in organ preservation solution is a practical technique for potentially converting damaged organs to transplantable organs that can be used safely in any clinical setting where organs are removed from donors.

Since metabolic impairment plays a major role in NAFLD pathogenesis, any pharmaceuticals, such as molecular hydrogen (H2), that advance lipid and glucose metabolism could be appropriate to tackle this complex condition. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of 28-day hydrogen-rich water intake on liver fat deposition, body composition and lab chemistry profiles in overweight patients suffering from mild-to-moderate NAFLD. Methods: Twelve overweight outpatients with NAFLD (age 56.2 ± 10.0 years; body mass index 37.7 ± 5.3 kg/m2; 7 women and 5 men) voluntarily participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. All patients were allocated to receive either 1 L per day of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) or placebo water for 28 days. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID NCT03625362). Results: Dual-echo MRI revealed that HRW significantly reduced liver fat accumulation in individual liver regions-of-interest at 28-day follow-up, as compared to placebo administration (P < 0.05).

It has been estimated that miRNAs regulate up to 30% of the protein-coding genes in humans. They are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes, including those involved in radiation-induced heart damage. Biomedical studies indicate that molecular hydrogen has potential as a radioprotective agent due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and signal-modulating effects. However, the impact of molecular hydrogen on the expression of miRNAs in the heart after irradiation has not been investigated. This study aimed to explore the involvement of miRNA-1, -15b, and -21 in the protective action of molecular hydrogen on rat myocardium damaged by irradiation. The results showed that the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) increased in the rat myocardium after irradiation. Treatment with molecular hydrogen-rich water (HRW) reduced these values to the level of non-irradiated controls. miRNA-1 is known to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy, and was significantly decreased in the rat myocardium after irradiation. Application of HRW attenuated this decrease in all evaluated time periods. miRNA-15b is considered to be anti-fibrotic, anti-hypertrophic, and anti-oxidative. Irradiation downregulated miRNA-15b, whereas administration of HRW restored these values. miRNA-21 is connected with cardiac fibrosis. We observed significant increase in miRNA-21 expression in the irradiated rat hearts. Molecular hydrogen lowered myocardial miRNA-21 levels after irradiation.

Subjects received either HRW or placebo, which was consumed the day before and the day of the testing. HRW was delivered using the hydrogen-producing tablets, DrinkHRW (5 mg of H2). All data was analyzed with SPSS using pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment. Results: HRW supplementation did not influence maximal or minimal indices of exercise performance (VO2, RER, HR and RR) (p < 0.05). However, HRW significantly decreased average exercising RR and HR (p < 0.05). HRW decreased exercising HR during minutes 1-9 of the graded exercise test (121 ± 26 bpm) compared to placebo (126 ± 26 bpm) and baseline (124 ± 27 bpm) (p < 0.001) without substantially influencing VO2. Conclusion: Acute supplementation of DrinkHRW tablets may benefit submaximal aerobic exercise performance by lowering exercising HR. Further studies are needed to determine the influence and practical significance of HRW on varying exercise intensities as well as optimal dosing protocols and the effects of chronic use.

Sixty rats were randomly divided into a hydrogen-rich water group and a control group, with 30 rats in each group. The two groups were randomly divided into three groups: pre-ischemic period, ischemic period and reperfusion period. After the heart was removed, it was fixed in a Langendorff device and perfused with an oxygen-balanced 37 °C perfusate. The control group was perfused with Kreb's-Ringers (K-R) solution, and the hydrogen-rich water group was perfused with K-R solution + hydrogen-rich water. The levels of mRNA and protein of Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1 and SOD-1 in cardiomyocytes were detected by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot analysis. SOD activity and MDA content were determined. Hydrogen-rich water increased the activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, and the levels of mRNA and protein Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1 and SOD-1 were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the ischemia-reperfusion period compared with the ischemic period. In the control group, the levels of mRNA and protein of Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1 and SOD-1 were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the ischemia-reperfusion period compared with the ischemic period. Compared with the ischemic period, the ischemia-reperfusion phase showed significantly increased SOD activity and significantly decreased MDA content in the hydrogen-rich water group, while SOD activity was significantly decreased, and MDA content was significantly increased in the control group (P < 0.05). Hydrogen-rich water can activate the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, alleviate ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated rat hearts and reduce the oxidative stress level of myocardial tissue.

Molecular hydrogen has been considered a preventive and therapeutic medical gas in many diseases including cancer. In our study, we sought to assess the potential role of molecular hydrogen on GBM. Methods: The in vivo studies were performed using a rat orthotopic glioma model and a mouse subcutaneous xenograft model. Animals inhaled hydrogen gas (67%) 1 h two times per day. MR imaging studies were performed to determine the tumor volume. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence staining, and flow cytometry analysis were conducted to determine the expression of surface markers. Sphere formation assay was performed to assess the cancer stem cell self-renewal capacity. Assays for cell migration, invasion, and colony formation were conducted. Results: The in vivo study showed that hydrogen inhalation could effectively suppress GBM tumor growth and prolong the survival of mice with GBM. IHC and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that hydrogen treatment markedly downregulated the expression of markers involved in stemness (CD133, Nestin), proliferation (ki67), and angiogenesis (CD34) and also upregulated GFAP expression, a marker of differentiation. Similar results were obtained in the in vitro studies. The sphere-forming ability of glioma cells was also suppressed by hydrogen treatment. Moreover, hydrogen treatment also suppressed the migration, invasion, and colony-forming ability of glioma cells.

Rats received 30 Gy whole-brain irradiation using a 6-MeV electron beam. Either purified water or HRW (0.8-0.9 ppm) was administrated at 10 min prior to irradiation, as well as a daily HRW treatment after irradiation for 30 consecutive days. The Morris water maze was used to test spatial memory in the rats. The concentration of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and the super-oxidedismutase (SOD) activity in cerebral cortex, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level in serum, were measured. Immunofluorescence staining was adopted to detect proliferating cells. The expression of BDNF-TrkB pathway-related genes and proteins were detected using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Models of cognitive dysfunction were successfully established using a 30 Gy dose of ionizing radiation. Compared to the radiation treated group, the radiation-HRW treated group showed significantly decreased escape latency (P < 0.05), but increased retention time, swimming distance of original platform quadrant (P < 0.05) and number of platform crossings (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the SOD, GSH (P < 0.05) and BDNF (P < 0.05) levels in the radiation-HRW treated group were higher compared to the radiation treated group. The MDA and 8-OHdG levels (P < 0.05) were decreased in the radiation-HRW treated group when compared to the radiation treated group. Additionally, treatment with HRW increased the number of BrdU+NeuN+ cells in the radiation treated group. The mRNA and protein levels of BDNF and TrkB (P < 0.05) in radiation-HRW treated group was higher than that in the radiation treated group. Collectively, our study indicates that HRW has a protective effect on radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction, and that the possible mechanisms mainly involve anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory reactions, and its protection of newborn neurons by regulating the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway.

Studies have demonstrated the role of hydrogen gas in the regulation of OS. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of hydrogen gas on the BRVO rat model. Methods: Twenty-four BRVO rats were randomly divided into two groups: the hydrogen gas (H) group (42% H2, 21% O2, 37% N2) and the model (M) group (21% O2, 79% N2). Rats in the H group inhaled hydrogen gas for 8 h every day up to 30 d post-occlusion. Twelve age-matched healthy rats served as the control (C) group. Retinal function and morphology were detected at 1, 7, 14 and 30 d post-occlusion. Furthermore, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-α) was detected by immunofluorescent staining. Results: Full-field electroretinography (ffERG) revealed that the amplitude of the b-wave (dark-adaptation 3.0 response), the amplitude of the OPs2 wave and the light-adapted flicker response in the H group were all higher than those in the M group at 7 d post-occlusion (all p < 0.05). The reopen time of occlusive retinal vessels in the H group was 2.235 ± 1.128 d, which was shorter than that in the M group (4.234 ± 2.236 d, p < 0.05). The rats in the H group had a thinner IPL + GCL + NFL and an increased total retina compared with those in the M group at 3 d post-occlusion (p < 0.05), while the rats in the H group had a thicker INL, IPL + GCL + NFL and total retina compared with those at 7, 14 and 30 d post-occlusion (p < 0.05). Moreover, the flow velocity of ear vein blood was increased in the H group compared with that in the M group (p < 0.05).

(1) Experiment one: some cells were acted by 1.25, 2.50, 5.00, 10.00 μmol/L hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 20 minutes to determine the appropriate concentration required for astrocyte damage induced by H2O2; cultivating 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours with hydrogen-rich water of 25, 50, 100, and 200 μmol/L, respectively, to determine the concentration and time of hydrogen-rich water pretreatment; the 50 μmol/L hydrogen-rich water was cultured together with PI3K/Akt signal pathway inhibitors wortmannin (WM) 200 nmol/L or 400 nmol/L to determine the best inhibition concentration of wortmannin. Astrocyte activity was detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetry. (2) Experiment two: some cells were divided into blank control group, H2O2 injury group, hydrogen-rich water pretreatment group (HW+H2O2 group), and co-culture of hydrogen-rich water and wortmannin pretreatment group (HW+WM+H2O2 group). The mRNA expressions of PI3K and Akt were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the protein expressions of PI3K, Akt and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) were detected by Western Blot. Results: (1) Experiment one: the survival rate of the blank control group was 100%. Cell activity gradually decreased with the increase of H2O2 concentration, and the survival rate of the H2O2 action 20 minutes cells of 2.50 μmol/L was reduced to about 50%, so a cell injury model was established at this concentration. With the increase of hydrogen-rich water pretreatment concentration, and the duration of action, the cell survival rate increased first and then decreased. The cell survival rate was highest when 50 μmol/L hydrogen-rich water was pretreated with 9 hours, so a hydrogen-rich water pre-protection model was established. After 200 nmol/L or 400 nmol/L wortmannin was cultured together with hydrogen-rich water, cell activity was inhibited, and the cell survival rate of 200 nmol/L wortmannin group was no significantly different compared with that of H2O2 injury group, so the astrocyte suppression model was established. (2) Experiment two: compared with the blank control group, the mRNA expressions of PI3K and Akt and the protein expressions of PI3K, Akt and p-Akt were significantly decreased in the H2O2 injury group. Compared with the H2O2 injury group, the PI3K, Akt mRNA expressions and PI3K, Akt, p-Akt protein expressions were significantly increased in the HW+H2O2 group [PI3K mRNA (2-ΔΔCT): 0.843±0.019 vs. 0.631±0.038, Akt mRNA (2-ΔΔCT): 0.591±0.025 vs. 0.558±0.037, PI3K/β-actin: 1.277±0.008 vs. 0.757±0.004, Akt/β-actin: 1.308±0.015 vs. 0.682±0.006, p-Akt/β-actin: 1.210±0.005 vs. 0.614±0.005, all P < 0.05].

One of the key mechanisms involves ischemia-reperfusion damage. Building on the well-known positive effects of hydrogen at mitigating this damage, the goal of this work was to demonstrate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects of inhaled hydrogen in domestic pigs during major liver resection. Methods: The study used a total of 12 domestic pigs, 6 animals underwent resection with inhaled hydrogen during general anesthesia, and 6 animals underwent the same procedure using conventional, unsupplemented, general anesthesia. Intraoperative preparation of the left branch of the hepatic portal vein and the left hepatic artery was performed, and a tourniquet was applied. Warm ischemia was induced for 120 minutes and then followed by liver reperfusion for another 120 minutes. Samples from the ischemic and non-ischemic halves of the liver were then removed for histological and biochemical examinations. Results: An evaluation of histological changes was based on a numerical expression of damage based on the Suzuki score. Liver samples in the group with inhaled hydrogen showed a statistically significant reduction in histological changes compared to the control group. Biochemical test scores showed no statistically significant difference in hepatic transaminases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), and lactate. However, a surprising result was a statistically significant difference in gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GMT). Marker levels of oxidative damage varied noticeably in plasma samples. Conclusions: In this experimental study, we showed that inhaled hydrogen during major liver resection unquestionably reduced the level of oxidative stress associated with ischemia-reperfusion damage. We confirmed this phenomenon both histologically and by direct measurement of oxidative stress in the organism.

Our previous studies demonstrated that hyperoxygenated solution could alleviate cell hypoxia. Furthermore, hydrogen-rich solution (HS) could relieve lung tissue inflammation, free radical damage and excessive cell apoptosis. Therefore we hypothesize that Hyperoxygenated Hydrogen-rich solution (HOHS) can protect the lung against ALI. Materials and methods: SD rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6 at each time point in each group) and were exposed to Hemorrhagic shock induced ALI, and then treated with lactated Ringer's solution (LRS), hyperoxygenated solution, HS, and HOHS, respectively. The protective effects of these solutions were assessed using methods as follows: arterial blood samples were collected for blood gas analysis; Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected for cell count and protein quantification; lung tissue samples were collected to measure wet/dry ratio, as well as levels of T-SOD, MDA, TNF-α, and IL-6; Caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive cells, and pathological changes were observed under light microscope; ALI was scored using the Smith scoring method; ultrastructural changes of lung tissues were further observed with transmission electron microscopy. Results: The results indicated that PaO2, PaCO2, and T-SOD increased in the three treatment groups (P < 0.05), most significantly in the HOHS group (P < 0.01) compared with the LRS group; and conversely that the levels of lactate, MDA, TNF-α and IL-6, cell count, protein content, caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive cells as well as ALI score decreased in the three treatment groups (P < 0.05), most significantly in the HOHS group (P < 0.01) compared with the LRS group.

In this study, aim at determine the effectiveness of slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) on biofilm removal and the disinfection of biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methods: Mucoid and non-mucoid strains were used for biofilm formation. Biofilms were incubated with SAEW and the reduction in biofilm volume was determined based on the optical density. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanism underlying the effects of SAEW, a biofilm was produced with alginate and structural changes in response to incubation with SAEW were observed by fluorescence microscopy. The minimum bactericidal chlorine concentration of SAEW for P. aeruginosa cells was evaluated. Results: The amounts of alginate and biofilm decreased by 99.9% and 56.8% immersed by 30 ppm of SAEW at 25 °C for 10 min. The effectiveness of SAEW increased as the temperature increased, and the biofilm volume was reduced by 85.4% at 45 °C. Furthermore, 30 ppm SAEW completely disinfected P. aeruginosa in the biofilm, even for immersion at 15 °C for 5 min.

The results indicated that the combined use of FW and HAP/Col significantly augmented both BV (12.25 ± 1.93 mm3, control: 3.22 ± 0.55 mm3, 6 weeks) and BMD (120.09 ± 14.76 cm3/mg vs. control: 54.67 ± 7.20 cm3/mg, 6 weeks) in a time‐dependent manner, which might be attributed to the soluble factor‐inducing ability of FW. Based on this assumption, bFGF concentration in peripheral blood was measured. bFGF concentration was significantly increased in the FW + HAP/Col group (68.25 ± 9.2 pg/ml vs. control: 21.70 ± 8.18 pg/ml, 6 hr). Real‐time PCR demonstrated significant augmentation of MCSF (2.82 ± 0.59‐fold), RANKL (2.51 ± 0.33‐fold) and BMP7 (1.66 ± 0.25‐fold) (bone regeneration‐related genes) and PDGF (1.31 ± 0.15‐fold), VEGF (3.27 ± 0.42‐ld) and IL‐8 (6.77 ± 2.02‐fold) (angiogenic genes) mRNAs in the FW + HAP/Col group. Taken together, these results suggest that the combined use of FW and HAP/Col induces bone regeneration, presumably by inducing the factors contributing to bone regeneration and angiogenesis.",Positive,Rat,Bone,Surgery/Transplantation,Fracture,Water (Electrolysis),Acidic,Irrigation,,Collagen/Hydroxyapatite,Japan

We evaluated the data using repeated-measures ANOVA test and one-way ANOVA test, and a significant difference was defined as P<0.05. Results: Hydrogen water significantly inhibited the growth, but not the biofilm formation, of C. albicans compared to tap water control at 1-, 5-, and 10-minute time points (P<0.05). Conclusions: The growth of C. albicans was slower in hydrogen water than in tap water, thereby suggesting an inhibitory effect of hydrogen water. Hydrogen water may, therefore, be utilized as an antibacterial and preventive agent without any harmful effect on denture and oral tissues.

NIHL is caused by formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cochlea causing oxidative stress. Hydrogen gas (H2) can alleviate the damage caused by oxidative stress and can be easily administered through inhalation. Objectives To present a protocol for untargeted metabolomics of guinea pig perilymph and investigate the effect of H2 administration on the perilymph metabolome of noise exposed guinea pigs. Methods The left ear of guinea pigs were exposed to hazardous impulse noise only (Noise, n = 10), noise and H2 (Noise + H2, n = 10), only H2 (H2, n = 4), or untreated (Control, n = 2). Scala tympani perilymph was sampled from the cochlea of both ears. The polar component of the perilymph metabolome was analyzed using a HILIC-UHPLC-Q-TOF–MS-based untargeted metabolomics protocol. Multivariate data analysis (MVDA) was performed separately for the exposed- and unexposed ear. Results MVDA allowed separation of groups Noise and Noise + H2 in both the exposed and unexposed ear and yielded 15 metabolites with differentiating relative abundances. Seven were found in both exposed and unexposed ear data and included two osmoprotectants. Eight metabolites were unique to the unexposed ear and included a number of short-chain acylcarnitines. Conclusions A HILIC-UHPLC-Q-TOF–MS-based protocol for untargeted metabolomics of perilymph is presented and shown to be fit-for-purpose.

This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of a hydrogen-rich preservation solution against ischemia-reperfusion injury after cold ischemia in rat lung transplantation. Methods: Lewis rats were divided into a nontransplant group (n = 3), minimum-ischemia group (n = 3), cold ischemia group (n = 6), and cold ischemia with hydrogen-rich (more than 1.0 ppm) preservation solution group (n = 6). The rats in the nontransplant group underwent simple thoracotomy, and the rats in the remaining 3 groups underwent orthotopic left lung transplantation. The ischemic time was <30 minutes in the minimum-ischemia group and 6 hours in the cold ischemia groups. After 2-hour reperfusion, we evaluated arterial blood gas levels, pulmonary function, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and histologic features of the lung tissue. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: When compared with the nontransplant and minimum-ischemia groups, the cold ischemia group had lower dynamic compliance, lower oxygenation levels, and higher wet-to-dry weight ratios. However, these variables were significantly improved in the cold ischemia with hydrogen-rich preservation solution group. This group also had fewer signs of perivascular edema, lower interleukin-1β messenger RNA expression, and lower 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels than the cold ischemia group. Conclusions: The use of a hydrogen-rich preservation solution attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat lungs during cold ischemia through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

Here we tested the hypothesis that H2 modulates cardiovascular, inflammatory, and thermoregulatory changes in systemic inflammation (SI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at different doses (0.1 or 1.5 mg/kg, intravenously, to induce mild or severe SI) in male Wistar rats (250-300 g). LPS or saline was injected immediately before the beginning of 360-minute inhalation of H2 (2% H2, 21% O2, balanced with nitrogen) or room air (21% O2, balanced with nitrogen). Deep body temperature (Tb) was measured by dataloggers pre-implanted in the peritoneal cavity. H2 caused no change in cardiovascular, inflammatory parameters, and Tb of control rats (treated with saline). During mild SI, H2 reduced plasma surges of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) while caused an increase in plasma IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) and prevented fever. During severe SI, H2 potentiated hypothermia, and prevented fever and hypotension, which coincided with reduced plasma nitric oxide (NO) production. Moreover, H2 caused a reduction in surges of proinflammatory cytokines (plasma TNF-α and IL-1β) and prostaglandin E2 [(PGE2), in plasma and hypothalamus], and an increase in plasma IL-10. These data are consistent with the notion that H2 blunts fever in mild SI, and during severe SI potentiates hypothermia, prevents hypotension reducing plasma NO production, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects strong enough to prevent fever by altering febrigenic signaling and ultimately down-modulating hypothalamic PGE2 production.

An increasing number of experimental findings have confirmed the relationship between the generation and clearance of free radicals, fatigue, and exercise injury. Recently, hydrogen was identified as a new selective antioxidant with potential beneficial applications in sports. The present study evaluated the effect of 2-month consumption of hydrogen-rich water on the gut flora in juvenile female soccer players from Suzhou. As demonstrated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and 16S rDNA sequence analysis of stool samples, the consumption of hydrogen-rich water for two months significantly reduced serum malondialdehyde, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-α levels; then significantly increased serum superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity levels and haemoglobin levels of whole blood. Furthermore, the consumption of hydrogen-rich water improved the diversity and abundance of the gut flora in athletes. All examined indices, including the shannon, sobs, ace, and chao indices, were higher in the control group than those proposed to result from hydrogen-rich water consumption prior to the trial, but these indices were all reversed and were higher than those in the controls after the 2-month intervention. Nevertheless, there were some differences in the gut flora components of these two groups before the trial, whereas there were no significant changes in the gut flora composition during the trial period. Thus, the consumption of hydrogen-rich water for two months might play a role modulating in the gut flora of athletes based on its selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

This study aimed to assess the neuroprotective effects of high concentration hydrogen (HCH) on DEACMP. Methods: A total of 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups. In the DEACMP group, rats were exposed to CO to induce CO poisoning; in the HCH group, the animals were exposed to 67% H2 and 33% O2 at 3,000 mL/min for 90 min immediately after CO poisoning. Neurological function was evaluated at 1 and 9 days after poisoning. Then, the contents of malondialdehyde, 3-nitrotyrosine and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, as well as superoxide dismutase activity in the serum, cortex and hippocampus were detected by ELISA. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Nrf2 and downstream genes were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Results: Our results showed that CO poisoning significantly impaired neurological function which was improved over time, and HCH markedly attenuated neurological impairment following CO poisoning. In addition, CO poisoning resulted in increased levels of malondialdehyde, 3-nitrotyrosine and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and markedly reduced superoxide dismutase activity at 1 and 9 days, which were significantly inhibited by HCH at 9 days. Finally, CO poisoning increased the mRNA and protein levels of Nrf2 and downstream genes, and HCH further induced the anti-oxidative capability.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a denture cleaning device that uses electrolyzed water on Candida biofilm on denture base-material and the physical properties of the denture material. Materials and methods: Denture base-resin disks were prepared with Polymethyl methacrylate. After the formation of Candida albicans biofilm on the resin disks, the antimicrobial activity of the denture cleaning device and the chemical cleanser against C. albicans biofilm was compared. The resin disks were also treated with the cleaning device and the chemical cleanser for 150 days, and the physical properties were analyzed by an atomic force microscope, Vickers hardness tester, and colorimeter. Results: The denture cleaning device and the chemical cleanser reduced the levels of C. albicans biofilm on the denture resin. Upon immersing of the resin disks for 150 days, the electrolyzed water of the denture cleaning device did not significantly change the surface roughness of the specimens, but significantly reduced its Vickers hardness compared to the initial value. The color changes of the resin disk were 0.477 ± 0.076, 0.612 ± 0.095 and 0.562 ± 0.096 after treating with tap water, the chemical cleanser, and the denture cleaning device, respectively. Conclusion: The denture cleaning device may be suitable for use by the elderly to clean dentures without side effects caused by the misuse of chemical cleanser.

To date, there is no specific therapy that exists, and its treatment represents a large unmet clinical need. Herein, we investigated the effects and underlying anti-inflammatory mechanisms of hydrogen gas in the setting of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiomyocytes injury. Experimental Approach: Hydrogen gas was intraperitoneally injected to mice in LPS plus hydrogen group and hydrogen group for 4 days. On fourth, LPS was given by intraperitoneal injection to mice in LPS group and to mice in LPS plus hydrogen group. In addition, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were treated with hydrogen-rich medium for 30 min before LPS. The transthoracic echocardiography was performed at 6 h post‐LPS to assess left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular ejection fraction (EF%), fractional shortening (FS%), left ventricular mass average weight (LV mass AW), and LV mass AW (Corrected). The histological and morphological analyses of left ventricular were performed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Masson’s trichrome staining. The mRNA levels of ANP and BNP were examined by PCR in vitro. The expression of cytokines were assayed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and PCR. Moreover, Western blotting was performed to examine the expression of TLR4, the activation of ERK1/2, p38, JNK, and the expression of NF-κB in nucleus after 6 h of LPS challenge in vivo and in vitro. Key Results: LPS induced cardiac dysfunction; hydrogen therapy improved cardiac function after LPS challenge. Furthermore, pretreatment with hydrogen resulted in cardioprotection during septic cardiomyopathy via inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-18; suppressing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK; and reducing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the expression of TLR4 by LPS.

A previously established RA model in D1CC transgenic mice aberrantly expressed major histocompatibility complex class II genes in joints, developing collagen II-induced polyarthritis and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies and interstitial pneumonitis, similar to those in humans. Molecular hydrogen (H2 ) is an efficient antioxidant that permeates cell membranes and alleviates the reactive oxygen species-induced injury implicated in RA pathogenesis. We used D1CC mice to analyse chronic lung fibrosis development and evaluate H2 treatment effects. We injected D1CC mice with type II collagen and supplied them with H2 -rich or control water until analysis. Increased serum surfactant protein D values and lung densities images were observed 10 months after injection. Inflammation was patchy within the perilymphatic stromal area, with increased 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine-positive cell numbers and tumour necrosis factor-α, BAX, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-6 and soluble collagen levels in the lungs.

The attenuation of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in such marginal donors is therefore crucial for reducing the possibility of the primary non-function of grafts and graft loss. Some reports have found that molecular-hydrogen showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in preventing IRI in some non-hepatic transplant models. Therefore, we investigated whether or not molecular-hydrogen could attenuate IRI in LT model rats. Methods: We used a hydrogen-rich water bath to dissolve hydrogen into solution and graft tissues and performed isogenic and orthotopic LT in Lewis rats with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. Blood and tissue samples were collected 6 h after the reperfusion. Hepatic enzymes in serum were measured. Pathological findings including the expressions of cytokines and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 in liver tissues were evaluated. Results: The concentration of hydrogen inside the graft tissues increased depending on the storage time, plateauing after 1 h. Serum liver enzyme levels were significantly lower and the histology score of liver damage markedly attenuated in the group given grafts preserved in hydrogen-rich UW solution than in the control group. The hydrogen-rich UW solution group also showed less oxidative damage and hepatocyte apoptosis than the control group, and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tended to be lower while the protein levels of HO-1 were significantly increased (n = 3-12 per group, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Storage of liver grafts in hydrogen-rich UW solution resulted in superior functional and morphologic protection against IRI via the up-regulation of HO-1 expression.

The ever-increasing levels of METH abuse worldwide have necessitated the identification of effective intervention strategies to protect the brain against METH-induced neurotoxicity. The protective effects of molecular hydrogen on oxidative stress and related neurodegenerative diseases have been recently elucidated. Herein, we investigated whether treatment with molecular hydrogen ameliorated the METH-induced neurotoxicity and spatial learning and memory impairments. Male C57BL/6 mice received four intraperitoneal METH injections (10 mg/kg, 3-h interval), and stereotypic behaviors and hyperthermia were observed. After METH treatment and behavioral observation, the mice were returned to their home cages, where they received water or hydrogen-rich water (HRW) ad libitum for 7 days. We found that the molecular hydrogen delivered by ad libitum HRW consumption significantly inhibited the METH-induced spatial learning impairment and memory loss evidenced in the Barnes maze and Morris water maze tests. Furthermore, molecular hydrogen significantly restrained the neuronal damage in the hippocampus after high-dose METH exposure. Ad libitum HRW consumption also had an inhibitory effect on the METH-induced increase in the expression of Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, glucose-related protein 78 (GRP 78), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), and p-NF-kB p65 expression and elevation of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels in the hippocampus. These are the first findings to indicate that hydrogen might ameliorate METH-induced neurotoxicity and has a potential application in reducing the risk of neurodegeneration frequently observed in METH abusers.",Positive,Mouse,Brain,Addiction,Drug Toxicity (Methamphetamine),Water (Dissolved),Neutral,Ingestion,,,China

Hydrogen (H2) has been shown to be effective in alleviating many diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effects of H2 on inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Methods: Osteoclast differentiation from Raw264.7 cells was induced with receptor activator NF-κB ligand (RANKL) with or without 60% H2. The number and resorption activity of osteocalsts were assessed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and pit formation assay, respectively. The expression of osteoclast markers and NF-κB phosphorylation were detected by western blot. NF-κB nuclear translocation was assessed by immunofluorescence. NF-κB transcriptional activity was analyzed by luciferase assay. Bone loss in mice was induced by ovariectomy (OVX). OVX mice were given either regular air or 60% H2. Bone structure was analyzed by micro-computed tomography and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The data were analyzed with one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. Results: H2 did not have any measurable effect on the proliferation of Raw264.7 cells. The number of osteoclasts and size of resorption pits of RANKL+H2-treated cells were 3 to 4 times less than RANKL treated cells. The expression of osteoclast marker genes of RANKL+H2-treated cells was 30% to 60% lower than RANKL-treated cells (P < 0.05). H2 markedly inhibited RANKL-induced activation, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of NF-κB (P < 0.05, RANKL+H2 vs RANKL). The amount and density of trabecular bone and bone mineral density of ovariectomized mice were significantly less than sham-operated mice (P < 0.05 OVX vs sham). The amount of trabecular bone and bone mineral density of OVX mice that inhaled H2 were more than 40% higher, whereas the levels of serum proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were more than 50% lower than those of OVX mice (P < 0.05).

Here, we assessed the neuroprotective effects of different hydrogen inhalation times for the treatment of HIBD. We induced hypoxia–ischemia in Sprague–Dawley rats (postnatal day 7, both sexes), followed by treatment with hydrogen inhalation for 30, 60, or 90 min. Morphological brain injury was assessed by Nissl and TUNEL staining. Acute inflammation was evaluated by examining the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and NF-κB p65, as well as Iba-1 immunofluorescence in the brain. Neural apoptosis was evaluated by examining the expression of P-JNK and p53 as well as NeuN immunofluorescence. Neurobehavioral function of rats was evaluated by Morris water maze test at 36 days after surgery. The results showed that hypoxia–ischemia injury induced the inflammatory response of microglia; however, these changes were inhibited by hydrogen inhalation. The inhibitory effects became more apparent as the treatment duration increased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, hypoxia–ischemia induced neuronal damage and increased the expression of the apoptotic factors, P-JNK, and p53, which were attenuated by hydrogen inhalation (P < 0.05). Hypoxia–ischemia caused long-term spatial memory deficits during brain maturation, which were ameliorated by hydrogen inhalation (P < 0.01).

Hydrogen gas has been reported to alleviate I/R injury by scavenging free radicals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) on renal I/R injury in aged rats. Materials and methods: A rat model of renal I/R injury was induced by 45-min occlusion of the bilateral renal pedicles and 24-h reperfusion. Physiological saline or HRS (8 ml/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 5 min before reperfusion. Parameters indicating renal function (blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr)) and those indicating oxidative stress (tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), tissue activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and tissue expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)) were measured. Results: After I/R injury, BUN, SCr, tissue levels of MDA and 8-OHdG, and gene expression of HO-1 were all significantly increased while tissue activities of SOD were significantly decreased. HRS reversed these changes, with the exception of HO-1 expression, which was increased further, and improved renal morphology. Conclusions: HRS improves the renal response to I/R in aged rats, possibly by reducing oxidative stress and upregulating HO-1 gene expression.

Vasopressin is one of the causes, and drinking large volumes of water shows an effect of suppressing an increase in cysts. On the other hand, it is known that hydrogen-rich water reduces oxidative stress and has a good effect on kidney injury. We examined whether drinking large volumes of hydrogen-rich water affected the increase in the sizes of cysts. Forty 5-week-old PCK rats were randomly assigned to four groups: C(Control), purified water; W(Water), water with sugar; H(Hydrogen), hydrogen-rich water; WH(Water+Hydrogen), hydrogen-rich water with sugar. They consumed water from 5 to 15 weeks of age. The intake of water in the groups in which sugar was added to the water (W, WH) significantly increased in comparison to C, but there was no significant change in the serum Creatinine concentration. The kidney weight per body weight in W was significantly decreased in comparison to C. The kidney weights in H and WH were significantly increased in comparison to W. There were no significant differences in the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the cysts to the whole area among the groups. This experiment showed that the effect of drinking large volumes of hydrogen-rich water was not significantly different from that of normal water, in terms of preventing an increase in the size of cysts in PCK rats. However, some papers acknowledge the influence of hydrogen water. Significant differences might become obvious if we change aspects such as the administration method or administration period.

Mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy, plays a major role in sepsis-induced organ damage. We have demonstrated that hydrogen gas (H2), a selective antioxidant, exerts protective effects in septic mice. Here, we hypothesize that the therapeutic effects of H2 on septic animals with liver damages may be exerted through regulation of the Fun14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUDNC1)-induced mitophagy pathway. Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to sham or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation and treated with 2% H2 gas inhalation for 3 h starting at 1 h after sham or CLP surgery. To verify the role of FUNDC1, the cell-penetrating peptide P (NH2-GRKKRRQRRRPQDYESDDESYEVLDLTEY-COOH) (1 mg/kg) that functions as a FUNDC1 inhibitor was intraperitoneally injected into mice 24 h before the sham or CLP operation. To evaluate the severity of septic liver injury, the 7-day survival rate, liver histopathologic score, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, respiration control ratio (RCR), and FUDNC1, P-18-FUDNC1, P62, LC3B-II, Tim23, and caspase-1 levels were evaluated after the sham or CLP operation. The results demonstrated that 2% H2 gas inhalation resulted in an increase in the 7-day survival rate, ALT and AST levels, RCR, and P62 and LC3B-II expression but decreased the histological score and FUDNC1, P-18-FUDNC1, Tim23, and caspase-1 levels after sepsis. However, no significant differences were reported between the CLP + peptide P and CLP + H2 + peptide P groups. These observations indicate that 2% H2 gas inhalation for 3 h may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for sepsis-induced liver injury through the regulation of FUNDC1-dependent mitophagy.

In addition, autophagy serves an important role in normal cardiac homeostasis, and obstructions to the autophagy process lead to severe consequences for the heart. Hydrogen exerts an effective therapeutic role in numerous diseases associated with I/R injury via its anti‑inflammation, anti‑apoptosis and anti‑oxidative properties. Therefore, the present study investigated the effect of hydrogen on the myocardial inflammation response and apoptosis in myocardial ischemic/reperfusion (MI/R) injury, and further explored the mechanism of PTEN‑induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin‑induced mitophagy in the protection of hydrogen on MI/R injury. MI/R injury was performed by surgical ligation of the left coronary artery in vivo and H9C2 cell injury was performed by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro. Hydrogen‑rich saline was administered twice through intraperitoneal injection at a daily dose of 10 ml/kg following the operation in the in vivo model, and hydrogen‑rich medium culture was used for cells instead of normal medium in vitro. The infarction size of hearts, the levels of creatinine kinase‑muscle/brain (CK‑MB) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), cardiac function, cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, levels of cytokines, apoptosis and the expression of autophagy‑associated proteins were detected in the different treatment groups in vivo and in vitro. The results demonstrated that treatment with hydrogen improved the myocardial infarction size of hearts, cardiac function, apoptosis and cytokine release following MI/R in rats. In vitro, hydrogen improved cell viability and LDH release following hypoxia/reoxygenation in myocardial cells. In addition, it was demonstrated that hydrogen exerted an anti‑inflammatory and anti‑apoptotic effect in myocardial cells induced by H/R via PINK1/Parkin mediated autophagy. These results suggested that hydrogen‑rich saline alleviated the inflammation response and apoptosis induced by MI/R or H/R in vivo or in vitro, and that hydrogen‑rich saline contributed to the increased expression of proteins associated with autophagy. In summary, the present study indicated that treatment with hydrogen‑rich saline improved the inflammatory response and apoptosis in MI/R via PINK1/Parkin‑mediated mitophagy.",Positive,Rat,Heart,Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction),Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) Injury,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

However, knowledge on the underlying signaling events remain poor. Having recent highlight of microRNAs(miRNAs) in mediating intestinal I/R injury, we hypothesized that HRS may protect intestine against I/R injury by regulating miRNAs. Method Mice were given intraperitoneal injection of saline or HRS once daily for 5 consecutive days before undergoing intestinal I/R which was induced by 60-min ischemia followed by 180-min reperfusion of superior mesenteric artery. The intestine was collected for histopathological assay, miRNA microarray profiling, Real-Time PCR, and Western blotting. Next, miR-199a-3p mimics or inhibitor were transfected into IEC-6 cells to explore the relationship between HRS treatment and miR-199a-3p. Results I/R-induced mucosal injury and epithelial cells apoptosis were attenuated by HRS pretreatment. A total of 64 intestinal I/R-responsive miRNAs were altered significantly by HRS pretreatment, in which we validated 4 novel miRNAs with top significance by Real-Time PCR, namely miR-199a-3p, miR-296-5p, miR-5126, and miR-6538. Particularly, miR-199a-3p was drastically increased by I/R but reduced by HRS. Computational analysis predicts insulin-like growth factor(IGF)-1, mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR), and phosphoinositide-3-kinase(PI3K) regulatory subunit 1 as targets of miR-199a-3p, suggesting involvement of the pro-survival pathway, IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR. In in vitro experiment, HRS treatment reduced miR-199a-3p level, increase IGF-1, PI3K and mTOR mRNA expression, restore IEC-6 cells viability, and this protective effects were reversed under miR-199a-3p mimics treatment.

We explored the renal protective effects of aerosol inhalation of a hydrogen-rich solution (HRS; hydrogen gas dissolved to saturation in saline) in a mouse model of septic AKI. Septic AKI was induced through 18 hours of cecal ligation and puncture. AKI occurred during the early stage of sepsis, as evidenced by increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, pathological changes, renal fibrosis and renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis, accompanied by macrophage infiltration and M1 macrophage-associated pro-inflammatory cytokine (Il-6 and Tnf-α) generation in renal tissues. Aerosol inhalation of the HRS increased anti-inflammatory cytokine (Il-4 and Il-13) mRNA levels in renal tissues and promoted macrophage polarization to the M2 type, which generated additional anti-inflammatory cytokines (Il-10 and Tgf-β). Ultimately, aerosol inhalation of HRS protected the kidneys and increased survival among septic mice. HRS was confirmed to promote M2 macrophage polarization in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.

Our previous studies have found that molecular hydrogen (H2), which has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptosis effects, had a therapeutic effect on a septic animal model through increasing expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of 2% H2 gas inhalation on sepsis-induced lung injury and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: Male wild-type (WT) and Nrf2-knockout (Nrf2-KO) ICR mice underwent sham or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation. Two percent of H2 gas was inhaled for 60 min beginning at both 1 h and 6 h after sham or CLP surgery. To assess the severity of septic lung injury, the 7-day survival rate, wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio of lung tissue, lung histopathologic score, pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)), anti-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin 10 (IL-10)), antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1)), and an oxidative product (malondialdehyde (MDA)) were detected after sham or CLP operation. The histopathologic changes were observed in lung tissues by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT), and MDA were detected in lung tissues by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The results indicated that 2% H2 gas treatment increased the survival rates, decreased the W/D weight ratio and the lung injury score, alleviated the injuries caused by oxidative stress and inflammation, and induced HO-1 level but reduced HMGB1 level in WT but not Krf2-KO mice.

Here, a biomembrane camouflaged nanomedicine (mPDAB) containing polydopamine and ammonia borane was designed to enhance PTT efficacy and mitigate inflammation. Polydopamine, a biocompatible photothermal agent, can effectively convert light into heat for PTT. Ammonia borane was linked to the surface of polydopamine through the interaction of hydrogen bonding, which could destroy redox homoeostasis in tumor cells and reduce inflammation by H2 release in tumor microenvironment. Owing to the same origin of outer biomembranes, mPDAB showed excellent tumor accumulation and low systemic toxicity in a breast tumor model. Excellent PTT efficacy and inflammation reduction made the mPDAB completely eliminate the primary tumors, while also restraining the outgrowth of distant dormant tumors. The biomimetic nanomedicine shows potentials as a universal inflammation-self-alleviated platform to ameliorate inflammation-related disease treatment, including but not limited to PTT for tumor.",Positive,Mouse,Whole Body,Cancer,Novel Therapy,Gas (Sustained Release),N/A,Injection,,Photothermal Therapy (PTT),China

Hydrogen molecule, a special antioxidant, can selectively scavenge highly cytotoxic reactive oxygen species such as ·OH, exhibiting a potential to treat AD by reducing oxidative stress. However, there is no effective route to realize the continuous and efficient accumulation of administrated hydrogen in AD brain owing to its low solubility. Here, we develop the small-sized Pd hydride (PdH) nanoparticles for high payload of hydrogen and in situ sustained hydrogen release in AD brain. By virtue of the catalytic hydrogenation effect of Pd, the released hydrogen from PdH nanoparticles exhibits high bio-reductivity in favor of effectively scavenging cytotoxic ·OH in a self-catalysis way. Bio-reductive hydrogen is able to recover mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibit Aβ generation and aggregation, block synaptic and neuronal apoptosis and promote neuronal energy metabolism by eliminating oxidative stress and activating the anti-oxidative pathway, consequently ameliorating the cognitive impairment in AD mice.

ADSCs were injected into liver parenchyma after hepatectomy. The serum and liver tissue samples were collected at different time points (preoperative, and postoperative at 1 d, 3 d and 7 d). Results: Compared with the IRI group, both ADSCs and HRS groups can promote liver function recovery, reduce oxidative stress, reduce inflammation, and promote liver regeneration. Compared with HRS, ALT and TBIL in ADSCs group were significantly decreased at 3 d, and AST was significantly reduced at 1 d. The activities of SOD and GSH-Px in ADSCs group were significantly higher than that in HRS group, but the MDA level in HRS group was markedly lower than that in ADSCs group at 1 d. IL-1β was significantly lower in the ADSCs group than in the HRS group at 1 day after operation. The expressions of HGF and PCNA were significantly higher than that in the HRS group at 3 day after surgery.

Rats were irradiated with a 6 MeV electron beam from a Varian linear accelerator. After skin wound formation, rats were individually administrated with distilled water, HRW (1.0 ppm) or HRW (2.0 ppm). We measured the healing time and observed the healing rate of the wounded surface. After irradiation, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the wounded tissues were evaluated, as determined using an MDA and SOD assay kit. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Models of skin damage were successfully established using a 44 Gy electronic beam. The healing time was shortened in the two HRW-treated groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, interventions of HRW resulted in a marked reduction in the MDA (P < 0.05) and IL-6 levels (P < 0.01). Additionally, the SOD activity in the two HRW-treated groups was higher than that in the distilled water group at the end of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks (P < 0.001). The EGF level was also significantly increased at the end of the 1st and 2nd weeks (P < 0.05). Compared with the HRW (1.0 ppm) group, the healing rate was higher and the healing time was reduced in the HRW (2.0 ppm) group.

Collectively, our data indicate that HRW accelerates wound healing of radiation-induced skin lesions through anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting that HRW has a healing effect on acute radiation-mediated skin injury, and that this is dependent on the concentration of the hydrogen.

Changes in biliary tract pressure and the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may lead to acute obstructive cholangitis (AOC) and cause liver injury via GJ and TJ dysfunction. Hydrogen has been confirmed to have a protective role in various organs during pathological conditions and inflammation. The present study investigated the function of junction proteins and the potential application of H2 in AOC‑induced liver injury. An AOC rat model was established by LPS injection through a bile duct catheter, while the distal bile duct was closed. The catheter sealing caps were removed and bile was allowed to flow out from the catheters at 12 h after LPS infusion. The potential application of H2 was studied in the AOC rat model with biliary drainage. It was observed that AOC induced the disruption of junction proteins of both GJs and TJs. H2 administration reversed AOC‑induced disruption of GJs and TJs after biliary drainage. The mechanism of this phenomenon suggests that H2 may have effectively attenuated AOC‑induced inflammatory and oxidative damage, and decreased matrix metalloproteinase activity. H2 may accelerate the reversal of AOC‑induced liver dysfunction, and this phenomenon may depend on reversing the inhibition of GJs and TJs.

In addition, these cells are in a state of energy shortage caused by mitochondrial dysfunction with a low level of PGC-1a. Recently, hydrogen gas was reported to activate PGC-1a, leading to the enhancement of mitochondrial activity. In the present study, we investigated whether hydrogen gas influences the proportion of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of 55 Stage IV colorectal carcinoma patients. We found that the proportion of terminal PD-1+ CD8+ T cells was an independent factor for poor prognosis. We also found that the proportion of terminal PD-1+ CD8+ T cells was reduced in 35 out of 55 patients(63.6%)and was increased in 39 out of 55 patients(70.9%)after treatment with hydrogen gas. The ratio of the terminal PD-1+ CD8+ T cells after hydrogen gas treatment to that before hydrogen gas treatment(terminal PD-1+ CD8+ T cell ratio)was found to be an independent factor predicting PFS and OS. Out of another 26 patients treated with nivolumab, 14 patients treated with a combined therapy of hydrogen gas and nivolumab showed a significantly longer OS than the remaining 12 patients who were treated with nivolumab alone.

Stressed groups were supplied with PW and HW, respectively, ad libitum and forced to swim for the stress induction every day for 4 consecutive weeks. Gross antifatigue effects of HW were assessed by swimming endurance capacity (once weekly for 4 wk), metabolic activities, and immune-redox activities. Metabolic activities such as blood glucose, lactate, glycogen, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as immune-redox activities such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase, and the related cytokines were evaluated to elucidate underlying mechanism. Blood glucose and lactate were measured at 0 wk (before swimming) and 4 wk (after swimming). Results: HW group showed a higher swimming endurance capacity (p < 0.001) than NC and PW groups. Positive metabolic effects in HW group were revealed by the significant reduction of blood glucose, lactate, and BUN in serum after 4 wk (p < 0.01, resp.), as well as the significant increase of liver glycogen (p < 0.001) and serum LDH (p < 0.05) than PW group. In parallel, redox balance was represented by lower NO in serum (p < 0.01) and increased level of GPx in both serum and liver (p < 0.05) than PW group. In line, the decreased levels of serum TNF-α (p < 0.01), IL-6, IL-17, and liver IL-1β (p < 0.05) in HW group revealed positive cytokine profile compared to PW and NC group.

Hydrogen-rich solution (HRS) may prevent antioxidant stress and inhibit apoptosis and inflammation. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of HRS on CPB-induced myocardial injury, and to investigate its potential regulation of the Janus-activated kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) pathway. The HRS treatment resulted in the significant upregulation of malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) and myeloper-oxidase (MPO), whilesuperoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were significantly downregulated, compared with the Sham group (P<0.05). Additionally, HRS treatment improved myocardial injury, and decreased the expression levels of cardiac tropo-nins, heart-type fatty acid binding protein, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, MDA and MPO, and increased SOD release in CPB rats (P<0.05). Additionally, in the CPB group without the HRS treatment, the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, JAK2, phospho-JAK2 (p-JAK2), STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) were significantly decreased, and Bax was significantly increased, compared with the Sham group (P<0.05).

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious injury to the central nervous system, and secondary SCI is closely related to excessive ROS generation. We hypothesized that hydrogen inhalation ameliorates SCI, and the mechanism of action may be related to the protective effects of hydrogen against oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial damage. Methods: Mechanically injured spinal cord neurons were incubated with different concentrations of hydrogen in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to confirm the protective effects of hydrogen. ROS and related proteins were detected with dihydroethidium fluorescence staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and western blotting. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting were used to detect neuronal apoptosis. ATP concentrations, Janus Green B staining, and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) status were assessed to investigate mitochondrial damage. RNA sequencing was performed to screen potential target genes of hydrogen application. Hydrogen was administered to mice after spinal cord contusion injury was established for 42 days. The Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) and footprint analyses were used to assess locomotor functions, and immunofluorescence staining of the injured spinal cord segments was performed to detect oxidative stress status. Results: Spinal cord neurons were preserved by hydrogen administration after mechanical injury in a dose-dependent manner. ROS generation, oxidative stress injury-related markers, and the number of apoptotic neurons were significantly reduced after hydrogen treatment. The ATP production and mPTP function in injured neurons were preserved by hydrogen incubation. The expression levels of Cox8b, Cox6a2, Cox7a1, Hspb7, and Atp2a1 were inhibited by hydrogen treatment. BMS scores and the footprint assessment of mice with SCI were improved by hydrogen inhalation. Conclusions: Hydrogen inhalation (75%) ameliorated SCI in vivo and attenuated neuronal mechanical injuries in vitro, and its protective effect on spinal cord neurons was exerted in a dose-dependent manner.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) on renal injury caused by cisplatin. Methods: Animals were divided into four groups as follows: normal control group, cisplatin control group, ERW control group and ERW + cisplatin group. Each group comprised 10 animals, which were orally treated with normal saline or ERW daily companion by administration of one dose of cisplatin for 28 days. Animals in the cisplatin group received an intraperitoneal single-dose injection of cisplatin (20 mg/kg body weight) as a single i.p. dose on the 25th day of the experiment. We determined the hydration state in urine and the level of serum markers of kidney function, the levels of glutathione (GSH) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) levels and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT) and superoxidase dismutase (SOD) in kidney and histopathological changes. Results: After administration of ERW, the reduced urinary osmolality was increased and elevated Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels in urine were significantly decreased in cisplatin-induced renal injury mice. Besides, the results demonstrated that significantly decreased elevated serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and the levels of TBARS in the kidneys that were induced by cisplatin. Moreover, ERW treatment was also found to markedly increase (p < 0.05) the activities of GPx, GR, CAT and SOD, and to increase GSH content in the kidneys. Histopathology showed that ERW protects against cisplatin-induced renal injury to both the proximal and distal tubules. Conclusion: ERW exhibits potent nephroprotective effects on cisplatin-induced kidney damage in mice, likely due to both the increase in antioxidant-defense system activity and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation.

In this study, the mild oxidative stress was induced in primary cardiomyocytes of rats, and H2 treatments significantly reduced oxidative stress damage and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Finally, as a pivotal transcription factor in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-apoptosis signaling pathway, the expression and phosphorylation of p53 were significantly reduced by H2 treatment in this rat model and H9c2 cells (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Conclusion: As a safe antioxidant, molecular hydrogen mitigates the progression of CHF via inhibiting apoptosis modulated by p53. Therefore, from the translational point of view and speculation, H2 is equipped with potential therapeutic application as a novel antioxidant in protecting CHF in the future.

Building on these studies, we investigated potential neuroprotective effects of hydrogen inhalation in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), focusing on apoptosis and inflammation. Methods: Forty-five 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 15 per each group): a sham group, ICH group, and ICH + hydrogen group. Induction of ICH was performed via injection of 0.23 U of bacterial collagenase type IV into the left striatum. Hydrogen was administered via spontaneous inhalation. Mortality and neurologic deficits were investigated at 6, 24, and 48 hours after ICH. To investigate the antioxidative activity of hydrogen gas, the expression of malondialdehyde was measured. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of TNF-a, IL-1b, BDNF, and caspase-3 expression were used to detect anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. Neuroprotective effect was evaluated by immunohistochemical and TUNEL staining. Result: At 6, 24 and 48 hours post-intracerebral hemorrhage, animals showed brain edema and neurologic deficits, accompanied by up-regulation of TNF-a, IL-b, BDNF, and caspase-3, which is indicative of neuroinflammation, neuroprotection, and apoptosis. Hydrogen treatment significantly reduced the level of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, neuronal damage, and apoptosis-related genes. This was accompanied by increased neurogenesis and expression of growth factor-related genes at <24 hours, but not 48 hours, after ICH. Conclusion: H2 gas administration exerted a neuroprotective effect against early brain injury after ICH through anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidative activity.",Positive,Rat,Brain,Stroke,Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) Injury,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,South Korea

It appears that alkaline water can be an effective alternative to sodium bicarbonate in preventing the effects of exercise-induced metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to investigate, in a double blind, placebo controlled randomized study, the impact of mineral-based highly alkaline water on acid-base balance, hydration status, and anaerobic capacity. Sixteen well trained combat sport athletes (n = 16), were randomly divided into two groups; the experimental group (EG; n = 8), which ingested highly alkaline water for three weeks, and the control group (CG; n = 8), which received regular table water. Anaerobic performance was evaluated by two double 30 s Wingate tests for lower and upper limbs, respectively, with a passive rest interval of 3 minutes between the bouts of exercise. Fingertip capillary blood samples for the assessment of lactate concentration were drawn at rest and during the 3rd min of recovery. In addition, acid-base equilibrium and electrolyte status were evaluated. Urine samples were evaluated for specific gravity and pH.

We investigated 2-weeks of HRW intake on repeated sprint performance and acid-base status during prolonged intermittent cycling exercise. Methods: In a cross over single-blind protocol, eight trained male cyclists (age [mean ± SD] 41±7 years, body mass 72.3±4.4 kg, height 1.77±0.04 m, maximal oxygen uptake [V̇ O2max] 52.6±4.4 ml·kg-1·min-1) were provided daily with 2 liters of placebo normal water (PLA, pH 7.6, oxidation/reduction potential [ORP] +230 mV, free hydrogen content 0 ppb) or HRW (pH 9.8, ORP -180 mV, free Hydrogen 450 ppb). Tests were performed at baseline and after each period of two weeks of treatment. The treatments were counter-balanced and the sequence randomized. The 30-min intermittent cycling trial consisted in ten 3-min blocks, each one composed by 90 sec at 40% V̇ O2max, 60 sec at 60% V̇ O2max, 16 sec all out sprint, and 14 sec active recovery. Oxygen uptake (V̇ O2), heart rate and power output were measured during the whole test, while mean and peak power output (PPO), time to peak power and fatigue index (FI) were determined during all the 16 sec sprints. Lactate, pH and bicarbonate [HCO3-] concentrations were determined at rest and after each sprint on blood obtained by an antecubital vein indwelling catheter. Results: In the PLA group, PPO in absolute values decreased significantly at the 8th and 9th of 10 sprints and in relative values, ΔPPO, decrease significantly at 6th, 8th and 9th of 10 sprints (by mean: -12±5%, p<0.006), while it remained unchanged in HRW group.

Hydrogen gas (H2), which has selective anti-oxidative effects, can be effectively used to treat septic mice. Mitochondrial dysfunction and dynamics play important roles in sepsis-induced organ damage. Methods: By using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), a classic septic model, we explored the role of 2% H2 treatment in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) linked to mitochondrial function and dynamics. We randomized male Institute for Cancer Research (ICR) mice into 4 groups: sham, sham + H2, CLP and CLP + H2. At 24 h after CLP or sham operations, we used histological examination and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to observe lung slices. We analyzed oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), mitochondrial-membrane potential (MMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, respiration control ratio (RCR) and mitochondrial-respiration complex activities (I and II) using commercial kits, and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and mitofusin-2 (MFN2) using Western blot. Results: Therapy with 2% H2 increased PaO2/FiO2 ratios, MMP and ATP levels, RCR, complex I activity and MFN2 expression but decreased histological score and Drp1 levels in the presence of sepsis. These data indicated that inhalation of 2% H2 to regulate mitochondrial function and dynamics may be a promising therapeutic strategy for lung injuries induced by severe sepsis.

The goal of this study was to explore if hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) plays a cardioprotective effect on abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats. 60adult Sprague-Dawley rats received surgically the AAC for 6-week. After the surgery, the rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (15 for each):1: sham-operated (sham); 2: AAC-model; 3: AAC + Low HRS (LHRS); and 4: AAC + High HRS (HHRS). The rats in sham and AAC-model groups were treated with normal saline intraperitoneally, while rats in LHRS and HHRS groups were intraperitoneally treated with 3 or 6 mL/kg HRS daily, respectively, for 6-week. Results: The ratios of HW/BW and LVW/BW were shown in an order of Model > LHRS > HHRS > SHAM groups. The cardiac hypertrophy was also manifested with increased expressions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) and fibrosis of cardiac tissues in AAC-model group, which could likewise be restrained in LHRS and HHRS groups. Moreover, the JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase-Signal transducers and activators of transcription) signaling molecule expressions were decreased with HRS treatment. Conclusions: Our results showed a protective effect of HRS on pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats, which may be associated to a decreasing in JAK-STAT signaling pathway.

It has been previously indicated that oxidative stress may contribute to allergic inflammation, including AR. Although molecular hydrogen (H2), an antioxidative agent, has been effective in treatment of numerous oxidative stress-associated diseases, the effect of inhalation of a high concentration of H2 on AR remains unknown. In the current study, female BALB/c mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) followed by intranasal OVA challenge to establish an animal model of AR. Mice were subjected to exposure to H2 and the inert gas helium at different frequencies and durations. The frequencies of sneezing/scratching and the body weights of mice were recorded. Histological analysis and multiplex cytokine assays were performed to evaluate the effects of H2 on AR. Challenge with OVA induced significant nasal mucosa inflammation. H2 inhalation reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells into mucosa and lowered the levels of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in serum. H2 inhalation slightly increased the level of interferon-γ, however the difference was not statistically significant. Treatment with H2 limited the weight increase in healthy mice and reversed the weight loss in mice with AR. Furthermore, H2 inhalation induced a therapeutic effect on AR in a dose-dependent manner.

Molecular hydrogen (H2 ) was reported to have protective effects on I/R injuries of various internal organs. In this study, we investigated the effects of H2 inhalation on pressure ulcer and the underlying mechanisms. H2 inhalation significantly reduced wound area, 8-oxo-dG level (oxidative DNA damage) and cell apoptosis rates in skin lesions. H2 remarkably decreased ROS accumulation and enhanced antioxidant enzymes activities by up-regulating expression of Nrf2 and its downstream components in wound tissue and/or H2 O2 -treated endothelia. Meanwhile, H2 inhibited the overexpression of MCP-1, E-selectin, P-selectin and ICAM-1 in oxidant-induced endothelia and reduced inflammatory cells infiltration and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8) production in the wound. Furthermore, H2 promoted the expression of pro-healing factors (IL-22, TGF-β, VEGF and IGF1) and inhibited the production of MMP9 in wound tissue in parallel with acceleration of cutaneous collagen synthesis. Taken together, these data indicated that H2 inhalation suppressed the formation of pressure ulcer in a mouse model. Molecular hydrogen has potentials as a novel and alternative therapy for severe pressure ulcer.

However, whether early aerobic exercise combined with hydrogen-rich saline (eAE-HRS) water can more effectively protect myocardial damage induced by acute myocardial infarction (MI) is still unknown. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of eAE-HRS in preventing MI-induced myocardial damage and explore the possible underlying mechanisms. After Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were given a intragastric administration of HRS (1.6 ppm) at a dosage of 10 mL/kg weight daily for 3 weeks and/or the SD rats were performed a eAE program with 3 weeks running training, the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated to induce MI. We assessed the effects of eAE-HRS on myocardial injury and oxidative damage in the MI model of rats and detected the effects of eAE-HRS on the expressions of cardiac OGG1 and Tom40, Tom20, and Tim23. The eAE-HRS increased significantly left ventricular systolic pressure, reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and potentiated + dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, heart coefficient and pH after MI injury.

The potential benefits of electrolysed reduced water (ERW), rich in molecular hydrogen, in improving symptoms and systemic oxidative stress associated with GERD was assessed. The study was performed on 84 GERD patients undergoing control treatment (PPI + tap water) or experimental treatment (PPI + ERW) for 3 months.

Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between scores and laboratory parameters. Overall results demonstrated that an optimal oxidative balance can be restored and GERD symptoms can be reduced rapidly via the integration of ERW in GERD patients. The relative variation of heartburn and regurgitation score was significantly correlated with laboratory parameters.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of hydrogen (H2) gas on hypertension induced by intermittent hypoxia in rats. The adult rats were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) 8 hours/day for 5 weeks and/or H 2 gas 2 hours/day. We found that the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) increased significantly in rats exposed to intermittent hypoxia, both of which were markedly attenuated after H treatment. Furthermore, intermittent hypoxia exposure elevated renal sympathetic nerve activity, consistent with plasma norepinephrine. Additionally, H 2 gas significantly improved CIH‐induced abnormal vascular relaxation. Nevertheless, inhalation of H 2 gas alone did not cause such changes. Moreover, H 2 gas‐treated rats exposed to CIH showed a significant reduction in 8‐hydroxy‐2 deoxyguanosine content and increases in superoxide dismutase activity, indicating improved oxidative stress. Taken together, these results indicate that H 2 gas has significant effects on the reduction of BP without any side effects. Mechanistically, inhibition of sympathetic activity and reduction of systemic vascular resistance may participate in this process via the antioxidant activity of H 2. Hydrogen (H2) is effective in preventing hypertension with no significant adverse effects via antioxidation. H2 downregulated sympathetic activity in rats with chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH).

We investigated whether ventilation with hydrogen gas during EVLP improves the donation after cardiac death lung function and whether this effect persists after actual transplantation. Methods: Ten pigs were randomly divided into a control group (n = 5) and a hydrogen group (n = 5). No treatment was administered to induce warm ischemic injury for 1 hour after cardiac arrest, and EVLP was applied in procured lungs for 4 hours. During EVLP, the control group was given room air for respiration, and the hydrogen group was given 2% hydrogen gas. After EVLP, the left lung graft was orthotopically transplanted into the recipient and reperfused for 3 hours. During EVLP and reperfusion, the functional parameters and arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) were measured every hour. Superoxide dismutase, heme oxygenase, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 were evaluated in lung tissue after reperfusion. Pathologic evaluations were performed, and the degree of apoptosis was evaluated. The wet/dry ratio was measured. Results: During EVLP and reperfusion, functional parameters and ABGA results were better in the hydrogen group. The expressions of superoxide dismutase (p = 0.022) and heme oxygenase-1 (p = 0.047) were significantly higher in the hydrogen group. The expressions of IL-6 (p = 0.024) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (p = 0.042) were higher in the control group, but IL-10 (p = 0.037) was higher in the hydrogen group. The lung injury severity score and the number of apoptotic cells were higher and the degree of pulmonary edema was more severe in the control group than in the hydrogen group.

Gut microbiota are deeply associated with our health through a symbiotic relationship. Recent reports have described that most gastrointestinal microbial species encode the genetic capacity to metabolize molecular hydrogen, meaning that molecular hydrogen might affect the gut microbial composition. Nevertheless, AEW effects on gut microbiota remain unknown. This study investigated AEW effects on the intestinal environment in mice, including microbial composition and short-chain fatty acid contents. After mice were administered AEW for 4 weeks, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal microbiota profiles. Organic acid concentrations in cecal contents were measured using an HPLC system. Compared to the control group, AEW administration mice had significantly lower serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and alanine aminotransferase activity. Organic acid concentrations of propionic, isobutyric, and isovaleric acids were higher in AEW-administered mice. Results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 20 taxa differed significantly in AEW-administered mice. Although the definitive role of gut microbes of AEW-administered mice remains unknown, our data demonstrate the possibility that AEW administration affects the gut microbial composition and that it has beneficial health effects in terms of cholesterol metabolism and liver protection.

Molecular hydrogen, which has been proposed to be an antioxidant that selectively reduces reactive oxygen species, was found to exert beneficial effects in Aβ injection-induced cognitive dysfunction. However, whether and how hydrogen affects AD pathogenesis remains uninvestigated. Thus, in the present study, APPswe/PS1dE9 (amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1) mice, a transgenic AD mouse model, were administered hydrogen-rich water for 3 months and the effects on cognitive function and molecular pathways were investigated. We found that hydrogen-rich water significantly improved cognitive behaviour in female transgenic AD mice without affecting Aβ clearance, and reversed the brain oestrogen level, ERβ, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expressions that were damaged in female transgenic AD mice, but not in males. Furthermore, hydrogen-rich water ameliorated oxidative stress and inflammatory responses more profoundly in the brains of female AD mice than in those of males.

C57BL mice were randomly divided into sham group, I/R group, hydrogen/oxygen group (HO), nitrogen/oxygen group (NO). Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 hour followed by reperfusion was introduced to animals which were allowed to inhale 66.7% hydrogen/33.3% oxygen for 90 minutes since the beginning of reperfusion. Mice in NO group inhaled 66.7% nitrogen/33.3% oxygen. 24 hours after MCAO, brain infarction, brain water content and neurological function were evaluated.

The experimental protocols were divided into the sham, saline treatment (control), and hydrogen treatment (H2) groups. In the H2 group, 15 mL/kg of hydrogen-rich saline (7 ppm) was gavaged daily for 7 days following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In the control group, normal saline was gavaged in the same way.

Short-term memory, sociability and social novelty, and sensorimotor gating were evaluated using the Y-maze, three-chamber, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests, respectively, at postnatal 3 or 4 weeks.

METHODS Mice were divided into four groups: (1) Regular diet (RD)/regular water (RW); (2) high-fat diet (HFD)/RW; (3) RD/EAW; and (4) HFD/EAW. Weight and body composition were measured. After twelve weeks, animals were sacrificed, and livers were processed for histology and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A similar experiment was performed using HRW to determine the influence and importance of molecular hydrogen (H2) in EAW. Finally, we compared the response of hepatocytes isolated from mice drinking HRW or RW to palmitate overload. RESULTS EAW had several properties important to the study: (1) pH = 11; (2) oxidation-reduction potential of -495 mV; and (3) H2 = 0.2 mg/L. However, in contrast to other studies, there were no differences between the groups drinking EAW or RW in either the RD or HFD groups. We hypothesized that the null result was due to low H2 concentrations. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of RW and low and high HRW concentrations (L-HRW = 0.3 mg H2/L and H-HRW = 0.8 mg H2/L, respectively) in mice fed an HFD. Compared to RW and L-HRW, H-HRW resulted in a lower increase in fat mass (46% vs 61%), an increase in lean body mass (42% vs 28%), and a decrease in hepatic lipid accumulation (P < 0.01). Lastly, exposure of hepatocytes isolated from mice drinking H-HRW to palmitate overload demonstrated a protective effect from H2 by reducing hepatocyte lipid accumulation in comparison to mice drinking regular water.

Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may induce DNA mutations, DNA damage, genomic instability and cell proliferation, and ROS are involved in several types of cancer, particularly lung cancer. In a previous study, hydrogen was recognized as an antioxidant in preventive and therapeutic applications. The PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway is an important signaling pathway that may activate downstream of a series of extracellular signals and impact on cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis and survival. To date, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has been indicated as a feasible target for novel antineoplastic drugs. Different strategies combining the two treatment modalities have been used in cancer therapy in order to achieve an improved therapeutic response and longer control of tumor modalities control. The present study investigated the effect of hydrogen‑rich saline alone and in combination with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, on the proliferation, oxidative stress and apoptosis of NSCLC A549 cells. This combination therapy may be more effective than separate drug treatment; it decreased the malondialdehyde level and increased the superoxide dismutase activity. The combination therapy also enhanced the efficacy of anti‑proliferation and apoptosis. Similarly, the results of the present study demonstrated that administration of the two agents in combination may inhibit phospho‑Akt activity, and reduce expression of heme oxygenase‑1 and nuclear factor‑κB p65. The results further suggested that the combination therapy may reduce cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis by downregulating Akt phosphorylation and inhibiting the PI3K pathway in NSCLC cell lines.

Augmented EMMPRIN secretion was not under transcriptional control; rather, it was derived from the intracellular storages. EMMPRIN secretion was also induced under oxidative stress and accompanied by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The molecules released from cells undergoing necrosis are called as alarmins, and the secretion of IL-1α, a typical alarmin, was induced by FW stimulation and oxidative stress. Intracellular localization was examined by cell fractionation. A significant amount of EMMPRIN was localized in the triton X-100 and DNase sensitive fractions; the levels were drastically reduced following FW treatment. The function of the released EMMPRIN was examined using the monocytic cell line THP1. Culture supernatant derived from FW-treated HSC3 cells induced the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 2, 8, 9, 13, and 14, platelet-derived growth factor, and interleukin-8. In contrast, vascular endothelial growth factor expression was reduced. Induction of these factors was abolished following eliminating of EMMPRIN by immunoprecipitation. These results indicate that EMMPRIN might be considered as a type of alarmin that transduces danger signals to the surrounding cells.

Here we investigated the influence of hydrogen-occluding silica microparticles (H2-silica) on cell migration motility and changes of the cytoskeleton (F-actin) in normal human esophageal epithelial cells (HEEpiCs). As the results, cell migration was promoted, and formation of microvilli was activated in the 100 ppm (low concentration) scratched group. After performing a wound healing assay, cells exhibited migration after 48 hours and 72 hours for both 10 ppm and 100 ppm groups, suggesting that the wound-repairing effects could be attributed to the antioxidant ability of H2-silica. In scratched groups, high levels of activated caspase-3 were relatively expressed and presented a tendency to increase the observed Bax/Bcl-2 ratio at more than 300 ppm groups. The above-mentioned results show that H2-silica induced apoptosis in HEEpiCs, especially in the scratched cells. Toxicity may cause an exaggerated apoptosis. Furthermore, since the ratio of fascin/tubulin in the 100, 300, and 600 ppm groups tended to increase in both the scratched and the non-scratched control groups, H2-silica was thought to be able to promote fascin action on normal cells and may be have a proliferative effect.

Previous studies have identified that oxidative stress is the common pathway in all possible hypotheses for the induction of DPN, and poly(ADP‑ribose) (PAR) polymerase‑1 (PARP‑1)‑dependent cell death (parthanatos) is key in the pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects and corresponding mechanisms of hydrogen‑rich medium (HM) on high glucose (HG)‑induced oxidative stress and parthanatos in primary rat Schwann cells (RSCs) in vitro. The RSCs were divided into groups and treated for 48 h. Cell counting kit‑8 and lactate dehydrogenase assays were used to detect cell viability and cytotoxicity, respectively; intracellular OH‑ levels were measured using a DCFH‑DA assay; concentrations of peroxynitrite (ONOO‑) and 8‑hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8‑OHdG) were evaluated with an enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay; relative expression levels of parthanatos‑related proteins [PAR, nucleus apoptosis‑inducing factor (AIF) and total AIF] were analyzed using western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence was used to determine the nuclear translocation of AIF. After 48 h, HG was shown to induce severe oxidative stress and promote marked levels of parthanatos in the RSCs. Treatment with HM inhibited HG‑induced oxidative stress by reducing the production of OH‑ and ONOO‑ and suppressed parthanatos by downregulating the levels of 8‑OHdG, the expression of PAR and the nuclear translocation of AIF. HM improved cell viability and inhibited cytotoxicity under the HG condition. These results indicate that HM effectively reduces HG‑induced oxidative stress in RSCs and protects them against parthanatos.

Seeking to ameliorate liver injury following I/R in fatty liver, we examined the protective effect of hydrogen (H2) saline on I/R liver injury in a methionine and choline-deficient plus high fat (MCDHF) diet-induced fatty liver mouse model. Saline containing 7 ppm H2 was administrated during the process of I/R. Livers were obtained and analyzed. Primary hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (KCs) were obtained from fatty liver and subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Apoptosis-related proteins and components of the signaling pathway were analyzed after treatment with hydrogen gas. The MCDHF I/R group showed higher levels of AST and ALT in serum, TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells, F4/80 immunopositive cells, mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines, constituents of the signaling pathway, pro-apoptotic molecules in liver, and KCs and/or primary hepatocytes, compared to the control group. In contrast, H2 treatment significantly suppressed the signs of I/R injury in fatty liver. Moreover, the expression of Bcl-2, HO-1, and Sirt1 in liver, KCs, and hepatocytes by hydrogen gas were increased, whereas caspase activation, Bax, and acetylation of p53 were suppressed by hydrogen gas. These results demonstrated that H2 treatment ameliorated I/R liver injury in a fatty liver model by reducing hepatocyte apoptosis, inhibiting macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokines, and inducing HO-1 and Sirt1 expression.

In this study, we applied nanobubble (NB) technology to hydrogen water. The antioxidant capacity of hydrogen NB water was studied with respect to different reactive oxygen species (ROS) both in vitro and in vivo. Using a relatively weak reduced dye, APF, we showed that hydrogen NB water can effectively remove three cytotoxic ROS, •OH, ClO-, and ONOO-, from water. Hydrogen NB water could also remove O2•-, which is a physiologically important ROS, from water. However, hydrogen water could not reduce other physiologically important ROS such as H2O2 and NO.

The objective of this study was to characterize differentially regulated proteins and biological processes in hydrogen-treated hyperoxic primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) to elucidate the protective mechanism of hydrogen using quantitative proteomics. Materials and Methods: AECIIs were divided into three groups that were cultured for 24 h in three different conditions: control (21% oxygen), hyperoxia (95% oxygen), and hyperoxia + hydrogen. Morphologic examination, flow cytometric analysis, cell viability assessment and analysis of the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins Bax and Bcl-2 as well as AECI markers (AQP5, T1α) and an AECII marker (SP-C) were performed for each group. The TMT labeling quantitative proteome technique was used to detect changes in the protein expression profile, and bioinformatics analysis was performed. Results: Hydrogen plays a protective role in hyperoxia-induced damage in AECIIs, as evidenced by reduced apoptosis, increased viability and survival, improved morphology, and enhanced transdifferentiation of AECIIs into AECIs. A total of 5782 proteins were identified in our study, of which 162 were significantly altered in abundance after hyperoxia exposure, and 97 were significantly altered in abundance in response to hydrogen treatment.

To improve quality of life (QOL), maintain a healthy state, and prevent various diseases, evaluations of the effects of potentially QOL-increasing factors are important. Chronic oxidative stress and inflammation cause deteriorations in central nervous system function, leading to low QOL. In healthy individuals, aging, job stress, and cognitive load over several hours also induce increases in oxidative stress, suggesting that preventing the accumulation of oxidative stress caused by daily stress and daily work contributes to maintaining QOL and ameliorating the effects of aging.

Thus, strategies aimed at suppressing inflammation are expected to be effective for reducing the risk of preterm birth and associated complications. Our previous studies demonstrated that molecular hydrogen (H2), an anti-inflammatory agent, prevented inflammation-induced impairment in foetal brain and lung tissues in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rodent models. However, it remains unclear whether H2 is capable of inhibiting preterm labour. The aim of the current study was therefore to investigate the effect of H2 on inflammation-induced preterm labour. Pregnant ICR (CD-1) mice were divided into three groups: Control, LPS and H2 water (HW) + LPS. In the control and LPS groups, vehicle and LPS, respectively, were intraperitoneally injected on embryonic day 15.5. In the HW + LPS group, HW was administered 24 h prior to LPS injection. The time from LPS administration to parturition was compared between the LPS and HW + LPS groups. Maternal uterus was collected 6 h after LPS injection and the transcript levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contractile-associated proteins (CAPs), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and endothelin-1 (Et1) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The time from LPS administration to parturition in the HW + LPS group was significantly increased compared with that in the LPS group (33.5±3.4 vs. 18.3±8.8 h, respectively, P=0.020). H2 administration also resulted in significantly higher progesterone levels compared with LPS treatment alone (P=0.002). The transcript levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, CAPs, Mmp3 and Et1 in the uteri of the LPS group were significantly higher than those in the control group (all P<0.05). In turn, all these levels with the exception of interleukin-8 and Mmp3 were significantly lower in the HW + LPS group compared with those in the LPS group (all P<0.05). The protein levels of Cox2 in the LPS group were also significantly increased compared with those in the control (P<0.001) and HW + LPS (P=0.003) groups. These results suggest that inflammation-induced changes in the uterus may be ameliorated through maternal H2 administration.

Summary: In the present study, we examined the effect of H2-containing PDS (commercially available neutral pH type) regarding the protection of peritoneal tissue in experimental chronic kidney disease rats. Furthermore, we conducted a 2-week clinical trial in which H2-containing PDS was used in place of standard PDS and its feasibility was examined. In the experimental study, test solutions were injected through the subcutaneous port into the abdomen for 3 weeks. Histological study revealed a significant increase in the number of mesothelial cells and a significant decrease in peritoneal thickness in the H2-PD group as compared to the control and PD groups. Also, results of immunostaining analysis revealed increased vimentin and apoptotic cells in the membrane of the PD group, indicating that H2 may play a role in ameliorating PDS-induced peritoneal injury and preserving peritoneal integrity. In the clinical trial with 6 prevalent PD patients, all subjects completed the study with no adverse effects. Moreover, there were substantial changes in surrogate markers, such as increased CA125 and mesothelin, in the effluent in selected cases, suggesting enhanced mesothelial regeneration by H2. Key Message: H2-enriched PDS is a candidate novel PDS with improved biocompatibility. Further, our results support the significance of H2-PD clinical trials in the future.

Results showed lipopolysaccharides significantly increased the M1 macrophages, and the supernatant from oxygen and glucose deprivation-treated neurons dramatically elevated the proportion of M1 microglia, but both treatments had little influence on the M2 cells. In addition, hydrogen treatment significantly inhibited the increase in M1 cells, but had no influence on M2 ones. Our findings suggest that the neuroprotection of hydrogen may be related to its regulation of microglia in the nervous system after stroke.",Positive,Cell Culture,Brain,Stroke,Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) Injury,Gas,N/A,Ventilation,,,China

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a mixture of H2 gas and CO gas (dual gas) in comparison with hydrogen gas (H2: 2%) alone on I-R renal injury (composition of dual gas; N2: 77.8%; O2: 20.9%; H2: 1.30%; CO: 250 parts per million). Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight 250-280 g) were divided into 5 groups: (1) sham operation control, (2) dual gas inhalation (dual treatment) without I-R treatment, (3) I-R renal injury, (4) H2 gas alone inhalation (H2 treatment) with I-R renal injury, and (5) dual treatment with I-R renal injury. I-R renal injury was induced by clamping the left renal artery and vein for 45 minutes followed by reperfusion, and then contralateral nephrectomy was performed 2 weeks later. Renal function was markedly decreased at 24 hours after reperfusion, and thereafter the effects of dual gas were assessed by histologic examination and determination of the superoxide radical, together with functional and molecular analyses. Results: Pathologic examination of the kidney of I-R rats revealed severe renal damage. Importantly, cytoprotective effects of the dual treatment in comparison with H2 treatment and I-R renal injury were observed in terms of superoxide radical scavenging activity and histochemical features. Rats given dual treatment and I-R renal injury showed significant decreases in blood urea nitrogen. Increased expression of several inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, nuclear factor-κB, hypoxia inducible factor-1α, and heme oxygenase-1) was attenuated by the dual treatment.

We previously reported that molecular hydrogen (H2) acts as a therapeutic and preventive antioxidant. Objective: We assess the effects of drinking H2-water (water infused with H2) on oxidative stress model mice and subjects with MCI. Methods: Transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative form of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 were used as a dementia model. The mice with enhanced oxidative stress were allowed to drink H2-water. For a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study, 73 subjects with MCI drank ~300 mL of H2-water (H2-group) or placebo water (control group) per day, and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores were determined after 1 year. Results: In mice, drinking H2-water decreased oxidative stress markers and suppressed the decline of memory impairment and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the mean lifespan in the H2-water group was longer than that of the control group. In MCI subjects, although there was no significant difference between the H2- and control groups in ADAS-cog score after 1 year, carriers of the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype in the H2-group were improved significantly on total ADAS-cog score and word recall task score (one of the sub-scores in the ADAS-cog score). Conclusion: H2-water may have a potential for suppressing dementia in an oxidative stress model and in the APOE4 carriers with MCI.

S.",Molecular hydrogen reduces acute exercise-induced inflammatory and oxidative stress status ,2018,Free Radical Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.09.028 ,"Physical exercise induces inflammatory and oxidative markers production in the skeletal muscle and this process is under the control of both endogenous and exogenous modulators. Recently, molecular hydrogen (H2) has been described as a therapeutic gas able to reduced oxidative stress in a number of conditions. However, nothing is known about its putative role in the inflammatory and oxidative status during a session of acute physical exercise in sedentary rats. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that H2 attenuates both inflammation and oxidative stress induced by acute physical exercise. Rats ran at 80% of their maximum running velocity on a closed treadmill inhaling either the H2 gas (2% H2, 21% O2, balanced with N2) or the control gas (0% H2, 21% O2, balanced with N2) and were euthanized immediately or 3 h after exercise. We assessed plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6] and oxidative markers [superoxide dismutase (SOD), thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and nitrite/nitrate (NOx)]. In addition, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of intracellular signaling proteins [glycogen synthase kinase type 3 (GSK3α/β) and the cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB)] that modulate several processes in the skeletal muscle during exercise, including changes in exercise-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. As expected, physical exercise increased virtually all the analyzed parameters. In the running rats, H2 blunted exercise-induced plasma inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) surges. Regarding the oxidative stress markers, H2 caused further increases in exercise-induced SOD activity and attenuated the exercise-induced increases in TBARS 3 h after exercise. Moreover, GSK3α/β phosphorylation was not affected by exercise or H2 inhalation. Otherwise, exercise caused an increased CREB phosphorylation which was attenuated by H2. These data are consistent with the notion that H2 plays a key role in decreasing exercise-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular stress.

Chelation therapy cannot correct the neurocognitive effects of chronic exposure. So, there is a requirement to test different protective agents for lead intoxication.

Oxidative stress, histological and immunohistochemistry using p53 antibody were used to investigate the toxic effect of lead and the possible HRW protective effect in rat hippocampus. Results showed that HRW corrected the elevated malondialdehyde levels (MDA) and restore the lead-induced depletion of antioxidant enzymes; glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). HRW does not affect the diminished nitric oxide (NO) level in the LA-treated group. Moreover, HRW reversed the LA-induced histological and immunohistochemical changes. It significantly decreased the percentage of the apoptotic index. We concluded that HRW protects the neurons against lead-induced oxidative stress and has anti-apoptotic effects without a noticeable change in NO level which already was diminished by LA.

Methods: Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) were infected with A. actinomycetemcomitans before being divided into a control group and a treatment group. The control group was treated orally with distilled water (pH 7.0), while the treatment group was administered with ERW (pH 9.8, 20 ml/day) for three successive days. Gingival tissue taken post-treatment was examined to determine the number of neutrophils and MDA level. Hematoxylin eosin staining was performed to identify neutrophil cells while MDA levels were determined by colorimetric assay. Results: The number of neutrophils in the control group (30.04 ± 15.30) was higher than that of the treatment group (7.76 ± 2.52), while the MDA levels of the control and treatment groups were 4.58 ± 0.66 and 4.30 ± 0.81, respectively (p < 0.05).

This microbicidal solution contains hypochlorous acid that is fast-acting and environmentally safe, as upon bacterial killing, the equilibrium shifts from hypochlorous acid back to salt and water. Other antimicrobial agents produced in this process include sodium hypochlorite and chlorine. The use of electrolysed water formulations in wound care to control wound bioburden is underway. However, there is limited evidence of the efficacy of electrolysed water on the control of biofilms, which are renowned for their tolerance to a variety of antimicrobials. Therefore this study aimed to assess a new electrolysed water formulation on in vitro Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Results showed that the electrolysed water formulation effectively reduced biofilm in all models following a 15 min contact time. Microbial cell counts confirmed the reduction biofilm bacteria. Additional cytotoxicity using L929 fibroblasts confirmed that a 50% and 25% dilution of the electrolysed water formulation was non-cytotoxic to cells. In conclusion, this study has confirmed that the application of a new electrolysed water product effectively removed biofilm after a short exposure time.

Although the underlying mechanisms of bmTBI are largely unknown, some studies suggested that bmTBI is associated with blood-brain barrier disruption, oxidative stress, and edema in the brain. The present study investigated the effects of novel antioxidant, molecular hydrogen gas, on bmTBI using a laboratory-scale shock tube model in mice.

The level of glutathione rose from approximately 500 to approximately 850 μM at the maximum dose of hydrogenized water with an EC 50 of approximately 0.030 mM. Hydrogenized water was also able to enhance the signaling pathway for oxidative stress response mediated by Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2 like factor).

Sprague Dawley rats were divided into a sham operation group, a CPB surgery group and a HRS group. A CPB model was established, and the hemodynamic parameters were determined at the termination of CPB. The myocardial tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin, and Masson staining. The levels of myocardial injury markers [adult cardiac troponin I (cTnI), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase MB (CK‑MB) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)], inflammatory factors [interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6 and tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α)] and oxidative stress indicators [superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] were determined by ELISA. Furthermore, H9C2 cells were treated with HRS following hypoxia/reoxygenation. Cell viability and cell apoptosis were investigated.

Following CPB, myocardial cell arrangement was disordered, myocardial injury markers (cTnI, LDH, CK‑MB and BNP), inflammatory cytokines (IL‑1β, IL‑6 and TNF‑α) and MDA levels were significantly increased compared with the sham group; whereas the SOD levels were significantly downregulated following CPB compared with the sham group. HRS attenuated myocardial injury, reduced the expression levels of cTnI, LDH, CK‑MB, BNP, IL‑1β, IL‑6, TNF‑α, MDA and MPO, and increased SOD release. Levels of Bcl‑2, AQP‑1, AQP‑4, p‑Akt, HO‑1 and Nrf2 were significantly increased following HRS; whereas Bax and caspase‑3 expression levels were significantly reduced following CPB. HRS treatment significantly increased the viability of myocardial cells, reduced the rate of myocardial cell apoptosis and the release of MDA and LDH compared with the CPB group. A PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) was revealed to reverse the protective effect of HRS treatment.

The decreased hydrogen production by intestinal microbiota may be associated with the development and progression of PD. We measured the amount of hydrogen production using gas chromatography by seven bacterial strains, which represented seven major intestinal bacterial groups/genera/species. Blautia coccoides and Clostridium leptum produced the largest amount of hydrogen. Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis constituted the second group that produced hydrogen 34- to 93-fold lower than B. coccoides.

However, its unfavorable features, ie, inflammability, low solubility, and high tissue/substance permeability, have hampered its clinical application. To overcome such obstacles, we developed a novel reconditioning method for donor organs named hydrogen flush after cold storage (HyFACS), which is just an end-ischemic H2 flush directly to donor organs ex vivo, and, herein, we report its therapeutic impact against hepatic IRI. Whole liver grafts were retrieved from Wistar rats. After 24-hour CS in UW solution, livers were cold-flushed with H2 solution (1.0 ppm) via the portal vein (PV), the hepatic artery (HA), or both (PV + HA). Functional integrity and morphological damages were then evaluated by 2-hour oxygenated reperfusion at 37°C. HyFACS significantly lowered portal venous pressure, transaminase, and high mobility group box protein 1 release compared with vehicle-treated controls (P < 0.01). Hyaluronic acid clearance was significantly higher in the HyFACS-PV and -PV + HA groups when compared with the others (P < 0.01), demonstrating the efficacy of the PV route to maintain the sinusoidal endothelia. In contrast, bile production and lactate dehydrogenase leakage therein were both significantly improved in HyFACS-HA and -PV + HA (P < 0.01), representing the superiority of the arterial route to attenuate biliary damage. Electron microscopy consistently revealed that sinusoidal ultrastructures were well maintained by portal HyFACS, while microvilli in bile canaliculi were well preserved by arterial flush. As an underlying mechanism, HyFACS significantly lowered oxidative damages, thus improving the glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio in liver tissue. In conclusion, HyFACS significantly protected liver grafts from IRI by ameliorating oxidative damage upon reperfusion in the characteristic manner with its route of administration. Given its safety, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness, end-ischemic HyFACS may be a novel pretransplant conditioning for cold-stored donor organs.

This study was designed to explore the hygiene improvement by electrolytically generated hydrogen warm water (40°C) on capillary blood streams, skin moisture, and keratin plugs in skin pores in normal good healthy subjects with their informed consents. Fingertip-capillary blood stream was estimated after hand-immersing in hydrogen warm water by videography using a CCD-based microscope, and the blood flow levels increased to about 120% versus normal warm water, after 60 minutes of the hand-immersing termination. Skin moisture of subjects was assessed using an electro-conductivity-based skin moisture meter. Immediately after taking a bath filled with hydrogen warm water, the skin moisture increased by 5-10% as compared to before bathing, which was kept on for the 7-day test, but indistinct, because of lower solubility of hydrogen in 'warm' water than in room-temperature water. Cleansing of keratin plugs in skin-pores was assessed by stereoscopic microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. After hydrogen warm water bathing, the numbers of cleansed keratin plugs also increased on cheek of subjects 2.30- to 4.47-fold as many as the control for normal warm water. And areas of cleansed keratin plugs in the cheeks increased about 1.3-fold as much as the control. More marked improvements were observed on cheeks than on nostrils. Hydrogen warm water may thoroughly cleanse even keratin-plugs of residual amounts that could not be cleansed by normal warm water, through its permeability into wide-ranged portions of hair-pores, and promote the fingertip blood streams more markedly than merely through warmness due to normal warm water.

In this study we sought to determine whether COX-2 was induced by asphyxia in newborn pigs, and whether neuronal COX-2 levels were affected by H2 treatment. Piglets were subjected to either 8 min of asphyxia or a more severe 20 min of asphyxia followed by H2 treatment (inhaling room air containing 2.1% H2 for 4 h). COX-2 immunohistochemistry was performed on brain samples from surviving piglets 24 h after asphyxia. The percentages of COX-2-immunopositive neurons were determined in cortical and subcortical areas. Only in piglets with more severe HIE, we observed significant, region-specific increases in neuronal COX-2 expression within the parietal and occipital cortices and in the CA3 hippocampal subfield. H2 treatment essentially prevented the increases in COX-2-immunopositive neurons. In the parietal cortex, the attenuation of COX-2 induction was associated with reduced 8'-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanozine immunoreactivity and retained microglial ramifcation index, which are markers of oxidative stress and neuroinfiammation, respectively. This study demonstrates for the first time that asphyxia elevates neuronal COX-2 expression in a piglet HIE model. Neuronal COX-2 induction may play region-specific roles in brain lesion progression during HIE development, and inhibition of this response may contribute to the antioxidant/anti-infiammatory neuroprotective effects of H2 treatment.

We mainly explored the function of hydrogen gas (H2) on cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion in lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1975 by CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. We used RNA-seq, qPCR and western blotting to detect the different expression genes (DEGs) between H2 group and control group to find the gene related to chromosome condensation. Besides, we confirmed the structural maintenance of chromosomes 3 (SMC3) and H2 on the progression of lung cancer in vitro and vivo. Results showed that H2 inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion, and catalyzed cell apoptosis and H2 induced A549 and H1975 cells G2/M arrest. Besides, H2 down-regulated the expression of NIBPL, SMC3, SMC5 and SMC6, and also reduced the expression of Cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6. H2 translocated the subcellular location of SMC3 during cell division and decreased its stability and increased its ubiquitination in both A549 and H1975 cells. In addition, inhibition of the proliferation, migration and invasion and promotion of the apoptosis of A549 and H1975 cells induced by H2 were all abolished when overexpressed SMC3 in the presence of H2.

It involves an impaired cell autophagy process. Hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) reportedly reduces allodynia and hyperalgesia in a neuropathic pain model; however, it is unknown whether these effects involve autophagy induction. Methods We investigated the relationship between HRS and cell autophagy in a neuropathic pain model generated by chronic constriction injury (CCI) in Sprague–Dawley rats. Rats received an intraperitoneal injection of HRS (10 mL/kg daily, from 1 day before until 14 days after CCI), 3MA (autophagy inhibitor), 2ME2 (HIF-1α inhibitor), or EDHB (HIF-1α agonist). The mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) were tested 1 day before and 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after the operation. HIF-1α and cell autophagy markers in the spinal cord were evaluated by western blotting and real-time PCR assays at 14 days after CCI. Autophagosomes with double membranes were identified by transmission electron microscopy. Results CCI caused behavioral hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimulation in the hind-paw of the injured side. HRS improved MWT and TWL, activated autophagy, and increased autophagosomes and autolysosomes in CCI rats. 3-MA aggravated hyperalgesia and allodynia and suppressed autophagy, while EDHB attenuated hyperalgesia and activated the autophagy procedure and the HIF-1α downstream target gene BNIP3. HIF-1α inhibitors reversed the regulatory effects of HRS on autophagy in CCI rats at 14 days after spinal cord injury.

Methods: Fifty-six Sprague Dawley rats were divided into sham injury group (n=8), burn group (n=24), and hydrogen-rich saline group (n=24) according to the random number table. Rats in sham injury group were treated by 20 ℃ water bath on the back for 15 s to simulate injury, and rats in burn group and hydrogen-rich saline group were inflicted with 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness scald (hereinafter referred to as burns) by 100 ℃ water bath on the back for 15 s. Immediately after injury, hydrogen-rich saline at the dose of 10 mL/kg were intraperitoneally injected to the rats in hydrogen-rich saline group at one time, while normal saline with the same dose were intraperitoneally injected to the rats in sham injury group and burn group. At post injury hour (PIH) 6, rats in the 3 groups were intraperitoneally injected with 4 mL·kg(-1)·%TBSA(-1) lactated Ringer's solution for resuscitation. Eight rats from sham injury group at PIH 72 and eight rats from burn group and hydrogen-rich saline group at PIH 6, 24, and 72 were sacrificed respectively after their blood samples from abdominal aorta were collected. Then their kidney tissue was harvested for histopathological observation and renal tubular injury scoring by hematoxylin and eosin staining, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were detected by the clinical blood biochemical analyzer, expression distribution and mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 in renal tissue were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and real time fluorescent quantitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction respectively, and protein expression of high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) was detected by Western blotting. Data were processed with Kruskal-Wallis H test, Dunn test, one-way analysis of variance, Bonferroni test. Results: (1) The renal tubular structure of rats in sham injury group at PIH 72 was complete with no inflammatory cell infiltration and no cellular degeneration or necrosis. Since PIH 6, the changes such as vacuolation and shape change of cells and aggregation of broken protein in renal tubules were observed in rats of burn group, and all these changes deteriorated with time. The renal injury of rats in hydrogen-rich saline group at different post injury time points were relieved compared with those of rats in burn group at the corresponding time points. The renal tubular injury scores of rats in burn group and hydrogen-rich saline group at PIH 6, 24, and 72 were significantly higher than the score in sham injury group at PIH 72 (P<0.05). The renal tubular injury scores of rats in hydrogen-rich saline group were significantly lower than those in burn group at PIH 6, 24, and 72 (P<0.05). (2) Except for those in hydrogen-rich saline group at PIH 6 and 72 (P>0.05), the levels of serum creatinine of rats in burn group at all the time points and hydrogen-rich saline group at the other time points were significantly higher than the level of serum creatinine of rats in sham injury group at PIH 72 (P<0.01). The levels of blood urea nitrogen of rats in burn group and hydrogen-rich saline group at PIH 6, 24, and 72 were significantly higher than the level of blood urea nitrogen of rats in sham injury group at PIH 72 (P<0.01). The levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen of rats in hydrogen-rich saline group at PIH 6, 24, and 72 were significantly lower than those in burn group at the corresponding time points (P<0.05). (3) There were certain degree of positive expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in renal tissue of rats in sham injury group at PIH 72, which were mainly observed in the cytoplasm of renal tubular epithelium cell. The expressions of above-mentioned inflammatory cytokines in renal tissue of rats in burn group at PIH 6, 24, and 72 were higher than those in sham injury group. The expressions of above-mentioned inflammatory cytokines in renal tissue of rats in hydrogen-rich saline group at all the time points were less than those in burn group at the corresponding time points. (4) Compared with those in sham injury group at PIH 72, the mRNA expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 of rats in burn group at PIH 6, 24, and 72 were significantly increased (P<0.01). The mRNA expression levels of TNF-α were significantly increased in hydrogen-rich saline group at PIH 6 and 24 (P<0.05 or P<0.01), and the mRNA expression level of IL-6 was significantly increased in hydrogen-rich saline group at PIH 6 (P<0.01). Compared with those at the corresponding time points in burn group, except for the mRNA expression level of TNF-α in hydrogen-rich saline group at PIH 6 showed no significant differences (P>0.05), and the mRNA expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 at the other time points in hydrogen-rich saline group were significantly decreased (P<0.05). (5) Compared with 0.39±0.03 in sham injury group at PIH 72, the protein expression of HMGB1 of rats in burn group at PIH 6, 24, and 72 (1.19±0.07, 1.00±0.06, 0.80±0.05) were significantly increased (P<0.05), while the protein expression of HMGB1 of rats in hydrogen-rich saline group at PIH 6, 24, and 72 (0.35±0.08, 0.47±0.06, 0.42±0.06) showed no significant differences (P>0.05).

In the present study, we investigated whether H2 treatment could improve the neurological outcome after TBI via increasing miR-21 expression. TBI was induced by controlled cortical impact in rats. H2 treatment was given by exposure to 2% H2 from 30 min to 5 h after TBI operation. Here, we found that H2 treatment significantly increased the expression of miR-21 in brain from 6 h to 3 d after TBI. The level of miR-21 expression in brain was significantly decreased after intracerebroventricular infusion of miR-21 antagomir in TBI-challenged rats with or without H2 treatment. Moreover, we found that H2 treatment conferred a better neurological outcome after TBI by improving neurological dysfunction, alleviating brain edema as well as decreasing lesion volume and blood-brain barrier permeability, which were significantly prevented by miR-21 antagomir. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular infusion of miR-21 agomir increased the level of miR-21 expression and decreased the lesion volume after TBI. In addition, H2 treatment decreased the levels of oxidative products (malondialdehyde and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α) and increased the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) in brain after TBI, which were prevented by miR-21 antagomir.

This study sought to evaluate the effects of hydrogen on hyperoxia-induced lung injury and to investigate the underlying mechanism. Primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) were divided into four groups: control (21% oxygen), hyperoxia (95% oxygen), hyperoxia + hydrogen, and hyperoxia + hydrogen + LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt inhibitor). Proliferation and apoptosis of AECIIs were assessed using MTS assay and flow cytometry (FCM), respectively. Gene and protein expression were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and western blot analysis. Stimulation with hyperoxia decreased the expression of P-Akt, P- FoxO3a, cyclinD1 and Bcl-2. Hyperoxic conditions increased levels of Bim, Bax, and Foxo3a, which induced proliferation restriction and apoptosis of AECIIs. These effects of hyperoxia were reversed with hydrogen pretreatment. Furthermore, the protective effects of hydrogen were abrogated by PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. The results indicate that hydrogen protects AECIIs from hyperoxia-induced apoptosis by inhibiting apoptosis factors and promoting the expression of anti-apoptosis factors.

Mitophagy plays an important role in eliminating damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria and maintaining mitochondria homeostasis. However, whether the protection of H2 on cerebral IRI is via regulating mitophagy is still unknown. In this study, OGD/R damaged hippocampal neurons were used to mimic cerebral IRI in vivo and we detected the effect of H2, Rap(autophagy activator) and 3-MA(autophagy inhibitor) on OGD/R neurons. The results of MTT indicated that H2 and RAP could increase cell viability after OGD/R treatment, while 3-MA further aggravated injury and inhibited the protection of H2 and RAP. Furthermore, the intracellular ROS and apoptosis ratio were determined, the results showed that ROS and apoptosis level significantly increased after OGD/R, H2 and RAP effectively restrained the increment of ROS level and apoptosis ratio but their protective effect can be weakened by 3-MA. Mitochondrial membrane potential(MMP) and mitophagy level were also determined, the data showed that H2 and RAP protected against the loss of MPP and increased the co-localization of mitochondria with GFP-LC3 while 3-MA exerted antagonistic effect.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether hydrogen gas could ameliorate endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a normal group, a model group, a nitrogen-oxygen (N-O) group, and a hydrogen-oxygen (H-O) group. EIU was induced in rats of the latter 3 groups by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After that, rats in the N-O group inhaled a gas mixture of 67% N2 and 33% O2, while those in the H-O group inhaled a gas mixture of 67% H2 and 33% O2. All rats were graded according to the signs of uveitis after electroretinography (ERG) examination. Protein concentration in the aqueous humor (AqH) was measured. Furthermore, hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunostaining of anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) in the iris and ciliary body (ICB) were carried out. RESULTS No statistically significant differences existed in the graded score of uveitis and the b-wave peak time in the Dark-adapted 3.0 ERG among the model, N-O, and H-O groups (P>0.05), while rats of the H-O group showed a lower concentration of AqH protein than that of the model or N-O group (P<0.05). The number of the infiltrating cells in the ICB of rats from the H-O group was not significantly different from that of the model or N-O group (P>0.05), while the activation of microglia cells in the H-O group was somewhat reduced (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Post-treatment hydrogen gas inhalation did not ameliorate the clinical signs, or reduce the infiltrating cells of EIU. However, it inhibited the elevation of protein in the AqH and reduced the microglia activation. ",Neutral,Rat,Eye,Uveal Injury,Endotoxemia,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,China

Hydrogen has been demonstrated to serve a protective role in diverse models of disease. However, the potential effects and mechanism of hydrogen with respect to ox-LDL-induced inflammation have not yet been completely elucidated. In the present study, various concentrations (0, 50 and 100 mg/l) of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were used to treat RAW264.7 cells. A Cell Counting kit-8 assay was used to determine cell viability and western blot analysis was performed to determine the expression of proteins that are involved in autophagy. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in ox-LDL-treated macrophages was detected using ELISA. Small interfering (si)RNA against sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was employed to investigate the mechanism underlying hydrogen-activated autophagy. The results indicated that ox-LDL stimulation promoted inflammatory cytokine expression and impaired autophagic flux in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, hydrogen inhibited ox-LDL-induced inflammatory cytokine expression by upregulating autophagic flux. SIRT1 mediated the upregulation of autophagic flux via hydrogen in ox-LDL-treated macrophages. To conclude, the present study provided novel insights into the role of defective autophagy in the pathogenesis of AS and identified autophagy to be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of AS.

Hydrogen-rich water was recently shown to exert neuroprotective effects in various neurological diseases through its antioxidant properties. However, the mechanisms underlying its effects in TBI are not clearly understood. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the neuroprotective role of hydrogen-rich water in rats with TBI and to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying its effects. Materials and methods: The TBI model was constructed according to the modified Feeney weight-drop method. In part 1 of the experiment, we measured oxidative stress levels by observing the changes in catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) expressions. We also evaluated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels to determine the role of the protein in the neuroprotective effects against TBI. In part 2, we verified the neuroprotective effects of hydrogen-rich water in TBI and observed its effects on Nrf2. All the experimental rats were divided into sham group, TBI group, and TBI + hydrogen-rich water-treated (TBI + HW) group. We randomly chose 20 rats from each group and recorded their 7-d survival rates. Modified neurological severity scores were recorded from an additional six rats per group, which were then sacrificed 24 h after testing. Spectrophotometry was used to measure GPx, CAT, and MDA levels, whereas western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry were used to measure the expression of Nrf2 and downstream factors like heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Results: GPx and CAT activity was significantly decreased, and MDA content was increased in the TBI group compared with the sham group at 6 h after TBI. MDA content peaked at 24 h after TBI. Nrf2 nucleoprotein levels were upregulated in the TBI group compared with the sham group and peaked at 24 h after TBI; however, no significant changes in Nrf2 mRNA levels were noted after TBI. Hydrogen-rich water administration significantly increased 7-d survival rates, reduced neurologic deficits, and lowered intracellular oxidative stress levels. Moreover, hydrogen-rich water caused Nrf2 to enter the cell nucleus, which resulted in increases in the expression of downstream factors such as HO-1 and NQO1. Conclusions: Our results indicate that hydrogen-rich water has neuroprotective effects against TBI by reducing oxidative stress and activating the Nrf2 pathway.

However, the nuclear factor erythroid‑2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway is a critical factor in protecting cells against UVB‑induced injury through inhibiting oxidative stress. Furthermore, Nrf2 activation requires the involvement of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, which has a major role in survival of various cell types. Molecular hydrogen exerts protective effects on UV‑induced injury, but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. The present study assessed the protective effects of hydrogen against oxidative stress‑induced injury caused by UVB irradiation and investigated the molecular mechanisms. In vitro, UVB‑induced HaCaT cells were collected for the detection of reactive oxygen species, 8‑iso‑prostaglandin F2α, malondialdehyde via fluorescence spectrometry and ELISA; cell activity and cytotoxicity by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase assays, respectively. Additionally, the expression level of PI3K, Akt, Nrf2 and heme oxygenase‑1 (HO‑1) were investigated using western blot, etc. All of the results indicated that hydrogen decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species, 8‑iso‑prostaglandin F2α and malondialdehyde, and promoted the UVB exposure‑induced expression of PI3K, Akt, Nrf2 and heme oxygenase‑1 in HaCaT cells. Of note, PI3K inhibition partially reversed the effects of hydrogen on UVB‑induced HaCaT cells. Therefore, hydrogen effectively protects cells from UVB radiation‑induced oxidative stress by inhibiting Nrf2/HO‑1 activation through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Hydrogen (H2) can attenuate lung injury and improve lung function in animal experiments. In previous studies, pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were used to simulate LIRI. We hypothesized that H2 can alleviate inflammatory injury in a PMVECs lung transplantation model in the cold ischemia phase. Methods: PMVECs were divided into 4 groups: Blank, Control, Oxygen (O2), and Hydrogen (H2). The Blank group included PMVECs without treatment. During the cold storage period, the O2 group was aerated with 40% O2 and 60% N2, and the H2 group was aerated with 3% H2, 40% O2 and 57% N2. The Control group was aerated without gases. The mixed gases were replaced every 20 min for 4 h. During the transplantation period, the sealed containers were warmed for 1 h at room temperature. In the reperfusion period, the containers were aerated with 50% O2, 5% CO2 and 45% N2 at 37 °C. Results: The concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α in the extracellular solutions were significantly decreased, and the concentration of IL-10 was increased in the H2 group. ICAM-1 expression was inhibited by hydrogen. Furthermore, hydrogen decreased the activation of NF-κB and phosphorylation level of p38. Cell apoptosis was alleviated. The pathological changes in the cell and mitochondria were alleviated after hydrogen administration. Conclusion: Hydrogen attenuated inflammatory response in a PMVECs lung transplantation model during cold storage.

Oxidative stress was considered an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of asthma. Hydrogen gas been demonstrated to function as a novel antioxidant and exert therapeutic antioxidant activity in a number of diseases and the function of this nontoxic gas in asthma was unclear. The purpose of the study aims to examine the effect of inhalation hydrogen gas on the pathophysiology of a mouse model of asthma. Methods A murine model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation was used in this study. Briefly, Mice were sensitized to ovalbumin and received inhalation of 67% high concentration of hydrogen gas for 60 min once a day for 7 consecutive days after OVA or PBS challenge respectively. Lung function was assessed in the apparatus with 4 channels of biological signal system. Morphology and goblet cell hyperplasia were stained by H/E and Periodic acid-Schiff staining. Cytologic classification in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed by Wright Giemsa staining. Serum, BALF and lung tissue were collected for biochemical assay. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine statistical significance between groups. Multiple comparisons were made by Bonferroni’s Multiple Comparison Test by using GraphPad Prism 5 software. Results Inhalation of hydrogen gas abrogated ovalbumin-induced the increase in lung resistance. Concomitantly, the asthmatic mice showed severe inflammatory infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia which were reversed by hydrogen gas inhalation. Hydrogen gas inhalation reduced significantly the number of total cells, eosinophils and lymphocytes in BALF. Increased level of IL-4, IL-13, TNF-α and CXCL15 in the BALF and IL-4 in the serum were decreased significantly after inhalation. Hydrogen gas inhalation markedly upregulated the activity of decreased superoxide dismutase and significantly attenuated the increased level of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase. Conclusions Hydrogen gas inhalation improves lung function and protects established airway inflammation in the allergic asthmatic mice model which may be associated with the inhibition of oxidative stress process.

As a novel and effective antioxidant, hydrogen has been proved to alleviate cellular senescence in endothelial cells in vitro. However, the effects and mechanisms of hydrogen on senescence in vivo are still unclear. In the present study, 12-month-old Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were intraperitoneal administration of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS, 10 ml/kg). Subsequently, bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) were harvested for the detection of hydrogen antisenescence effects and mechanisms. The results showed that the number of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) positive cells was reduced in BMSCs from rats treated with HRS. BMSCs in rats treated with HRS possessed a better proliferation ability, showed more effectively tri-lineage differentiation potential, and had less percentage of cells in G1 cell cycle arrest than the control cells. Additionally, HRS administration inhibited the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the expression of senescence-related proteins p53 and p21. Our results revealed that hydrogen could alleviate cellular senescence in vivo. And the underlying mechanism of antisenescence effects of hydrogen in BMSCs was via the ROS/p53/p21 signaling pathway.

Hyperoxia exposure increased glutathione content in lung homogenate (36%) more than hyperoxia+H2 (21%), consistent with increases measured in Tc-HMPAO lung uptake. In 60-hr hyperoxia rats, pleural effusion, which was undetectable in normoxia rats, averaged 9.3 gram/rat, and lung tissue 3-nitrotyrosine expression increased by 790%. Increases were reduced by 69% and 59%, respectively, in 60-hr hyperoxia+H2 rats. This study detects and tracks the anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties of H2 therapy in vivo after as early as 24 hrs of hyperoxia exposure.

The effects of the solution of H2 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or PBS alone topically applied on the alkali-injured rabbit cornea with 0.25 M NaOH were investigated using immunohistochemical and biochemical methods. Central corneal thickness taken as an index of corneal hydration was measured with an ultrasonic pachymeter. Results show that irrigation of the damaged eyes with H2 solution immediately after the injury and then within next five days renewed corneal transparency lost after the injury and reduced corneal hydration increased after the injury to physiological levels within ten days after the injury. In contrast, in injured corneas treated with PBS, the transparency of damaged corneas remained lost and corneal hydration elevated. Later results-on day 20 after the injury-showed that in alkali-injured corneas treated with H2 solution the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, peroxynitrite, detected by nitrotyrosine residues (NT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) expressions were very low or absent compared to PBS treated injured corneas, where NT and MDA expressions were present.

We previously found that UVB irradiation of the cornea caused the imbalance between the antioxidant and prooxidant enzymes in the corneal epithelium, followed by the imbalance between metalloproteinases and their physiological inhibitors (imbalances in favour of prooxidants and metalloproteinases) contributing to oxidative stress and development of the intracorneal inflammation. Here we investigate the effect of H2 dissolved in PBS in the concentration 0.5 ppm wt/vol, applied on rabbit corneas during UVB irradiation and healing (UVB doses 1.01 J/cm2 once daily for four days). Some irradiated corneas remained untreated or buffer treated. In these corneas the oxidative stress appeared, followed by the excessive inflammation. Malondiladehyde and peroxynitrite expressions were present. The corneas healed with scar formation and neovascularization. In contrast, in H2 treated irradiated corneas oxidative stress was suppressed and malondiladehyde and peroxynitrite expressions were absent. The corneas healed with the restoration of transparency. The study provides the first evidence of the role of H2 in prevention of oxidative and nitrosative stress in UVB irradiated corneas, which may represent a novel prophylactic approach to corneal photodamage.

Recent animal studies demonstrated that inhalation of hydrogen greatly mitigates postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and brain injury. However, the influence of underlying heart disease on the efficacy of hydrogen is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of hydrogen inhalation on neurological outcome and survival in a cardiac arrest model of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Methods: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated after 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation in 40 SHRs. Immediately after successful resuscitation, animals were randomized to be ventilated with 98% oxygen and 2% nitrogen under normothermia (Ctrl), 2% nitrogen under hypothermia (TH), 2% hydrogen under normothermia (H2), or 2% hydrogen under hypothermia (H2+TH) for 2 h. Hypothermia was maintained at 33°C for 2 h. Animals were observed up to 96 h for assessment of survival and neurologic recovery. Results: No statistical differences in baseline measurements were observed among groups and all the animals were successfully resuscitated. Compared with Ctrl, serum cardiac troponin T measured at 5 h and myocardial damage score measured at 96 h after resuscitation were markedly reduced in H2, TH, and H2+TH groups. Compared with Ctrl and TH, astroglial protein S100 beta measured during the earlier postresuscitation period, and neurological deficit score and neuronal damage score measured at 96 h were considerably lower in both H2 and H2+TH groups. Ninety-six hours survival rates were significantly higher in the H2 (80.0%) and H2+TH (90.0%) groups than TH (30.0%) and to Ctrl (30.0%).

To date, the related mechanism and effective therapy have not been rigorously explored. The present study aims to investigate the reno-protection of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) against ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI. Methods: Adult male C57 mice were randomly allocated into three groups: Sham, IR, IR+HRS. Renal IR injury model was generated via 35 min occlusion of bilateral kidney pedicles, and then, mice were administered with different treatments intraperitoneally in various groups. After 14- or 28-day treatment, mice were perfused and the kidneys were collected following reperfusion. Many proteins were detected by western blots, including renal fibrotic proteins [a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), collagen I (Col I)], Klotho, the methylation of Klotho, damage-regulated autophagy modulator (Beclin-1), and microtubule-associated protein light 3-II (LC3-II). Finally, the levels of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) were measured to investigate the renal function. Results: Histological data showed that the HRS treatment significantly decreased the fibrosis in renal tissues when compared with the IR group, and both of BUN and Cr were lower in the HRS group than IR group (8.9 ± 0.6 vs. 9.9 ± 0.1 mmol/l, 51 ± 6.5 vs. 60 ± 5.8 μmol/l) (P < 0.05). The expression of fibrotic markers, a-SMA and Col I, showed a robust increase in IR injury models than the Sham group, which was consistent with the result of Trichrome staining. However, the levels of a-SMA and Col I expression were sharply decreased in the IR+HRS group (P < 0.05). IR injury also enhanced LC3-II and Beclin-1 expression, but decreased Klotho level. The Klotho level was alleviated by HRS, but LC3-II and Beclin-1 were starkly enhanced in HRS group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: HRS showed a protective effect in the prevention of renal injury and could inhibit renal fibrosis after IR injury in mice.

A hydrogen-rich solution (HRS) can prevent oxidation and apoptosis, and inhibit inflammation. This study investigated effects of HRS on brain injury induced by CPB and regulatory mechanisms of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway. Methods: A rat CPB model and an in vitro cell hypoxia model were established. After HRS treatment, Rat behavior was measured using neurological deficit score; Evans blue (EB) was used to assess permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB); HE staining was used to observe pathological changes; Inflammatory factors and brain injury markers were detected by ELISA; the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway-related proteins and apoptosis were assessed by western blot, immunohistochemistry and qRT -PCR analyses of brain tissue and neurons. Results: After CPB, brain tissue anatomy was disordered, and cell structure was abnormal. Brain tissue EB content increased. There was an increase in the number of apoptotic cells, an increase in expression of Bax and caspase-3, a decrease in expression of Bcl2, and increases in levels of Akt, GSK3β, P-Akt, and P-GSK3β in brain tissue. HRS treatment attenuated the inflammatory reaction ,brain tissue EB content was significantly reduced and significantly decreased expression levels of Bax, caspase-3, Akt, GSK3β, P-Akt, and P-GSK3β in the brain. After adding the PI3K signaling pathway inhibitor, LY294002, to rat cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs), HRS could reduce activated Akt expression and downstream regulatory gene phosphorylation of GSK3β expression, and inhibit CMEC apoptosis.

The present study investigated the effects of hydrogen-rich saline, a selective hydroxyl radical scavenger, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Material/Methods Male ICR mice were divided randomly into 5 groups: Control, LPS-treated plus vehicle treatment, and LPS-treated plus hydrogen-rich saline (2.5, 5, or 10 ml/kg) treatment. Twenty-eight days later, fibrosis was assessed by determination of collagen deposition, hydroxyproline, and type I collagen levels. Development of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was identified by examining protein expressions of E-cadherin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 content, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were determined. Results Mice exhibited increases in collagen deposition, hydroxyproline, type I collagen contents, and TGF-β1 production in lung tissues after LPS treatment. LPS-induced lung fibrosis was associated with increased expression of α-SMA, as well as decreased expression of E-cadherin. In addition, LPS treatment increased MDA levels but decreased T-AOC, CAT, and SOD activities in lung tissues, indicating that LPS induced pulmonary oxidative stress. Hydrogen-rich saline treatment at doses of 2.5, 5, or 10 ml/kg significantly attenuated LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis. LPS-induced loss of E-cadherin in lung tissues was largely reversed, whereas the acquisition of α-SMA was dramatically decreased by hydrogen-rich saline treatment.

Ototoxicity may be reduced by co-administration of an otoprotective agent, but the results in humans have so far been modest. Aim: The present preclinical in vivo study aimed to explore the protective efficacy of hydrogen (H2) inhalation on ototoxicity induced by intravenous cisplatin. Materials and Methods: Albino guinea pigs were divided into four groups. The Cispt (n = 11) and Cispt+H2 (n = 11) groups were given intravenous cisplatin (8 mg/kg b.w., injection rate 0.2 ml/min). Immediately after, the Cispt+H2 group also received gaseous H2 (2% in air, 60 min). The H2 group (n = 5) received only H2 and the Control group (n = 7) received neither cisplatin nor H2. Ototoxicity was assessed by measuring frequency specific ABR thresholds before and 96 h after treatment, loss of inner (IHCs) and outer (OHCs) hair cells, and by performing densitometry-based immunohistochemistry analysis of cochlear synaptophysin, organic transporter 2 (OCT2), and copper transporter 1 (CTR1) at 12 and 7 mm from the round window. By utilizing metabolomics analysis of perilymph the change of metabolites in the perilymph was assessed. Results: Cisplatin induced electrophysiological threshold shifts, hair cell loss, and reduced synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the synapse area around the IHCs and OHCs. H2 inhalation mitigated all these effects. Cisplatin also reduced the OCT2 intensity in the inner and outer pillar cells and in the stria vascularis as well as the CTR1 intensity in the synapse area around the IHCs, the Deiters' cells, and the stria vascularis. H2 prevented the majority of these effects. Conclusion: H2 inhalation can reduce cisplatin-induced ototoxicity on functional, cellular, and subcellular levels. It is proposed that synaptopathy may serve as a marker for cisplatin ototoxicity.

Animals were divided into four groups: normal group; vehicle group: sham-operated rats administered saline; hSCI group: subjected to hSCI and administered saline; HRST group: subjected to hSCI and administered HS. Hind limb neurological function, testis index, testicular morphology, mean seminiferous tubular diameter (MSTD) and seminiferous epithelial thickness (MSET), the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), mitofusin-2 (MFN-2), and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), cell ultrastructure, and apoptosis of spermatogenic cells were studied. The results indicated that hSCI significantly decreased the hind limb neurological function, testis index, MSTD, and MSET, and induced severe testicular morphological injury. The MFN-2 level was decreased, and HO-1 and HMGB-1 were overexpressed in testicular tissues. In addition, hSCI accelerated the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells and the ultrastructural damage of cells in the hypophysis and testis. After HS administration, all these parameters were considerably improved, and the characteristics of hSCI testes were similar to those of normal control testes. Taken together, HS administration can promote the recovery of testicular biological function by anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic action. More importantly, HS can inhibit the hSCI-induced ultrastructural changes in gonadotrophs, ameliorate the abnormal regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis, and thereby promote the recovery of testicular injury. HS administration also inhibited the hSCI-induced ultrastructural changes in testicular spermatogenic cells, Sertoli cells and interstitial cells.",Positive,Rat,Testes,Spinal Cord Injury,Testicular Injury,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

Thirty rats were divided equally into six groups; 1) sham, no I/R or transfusion, 2) I/R injury (60 minutes ischemia + 120 minutes reperfusion, 3) I/R injury + normal saline 24°C, 4) I/R injury + normal saline 4°C, 5) I/R injury + HRSS 24°C, 6) I/R injury + HRSS 4°C. In groups 3-6, 1 mg/kg normal saline (NS) and/or HRSS were administered into the vein of the left lateral and median lobes of the liver (upper the site of clumping) 10 minutes before finishing of ischemic period. The harvest time points were at 2 hours post reperfusion in all groups. Cell death, sinusoidal dilatation, congestion, hemorrhage, and neutrophil infiltration were observed in I/R group, while these histopathological changes were attenuated in the hypothermic HRSS administrated groups (P < 0.01). The level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, malondialdehyde, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor a, and caspase-3 were increased significantly by I/R injury and hypothermic HRSS administration reduced all these markers (P < 0.01). SOD level was low in I/R group whereas it tended to increase in the hypothermic HRSS administrated groups (P < 0.01).

Batches of aflatoxin-contaminated maize were detoxified with NEW and mixed in commercial feed. A total of 240 6-day-old female large white Nicholas-700 turkey poults were randomly divided into four treatments of six replicates each (10 turkeys per replicate), which were fed ad libitum for two weeks with the following dietary treatments: (1) control feed containing aflatoxin-free maize (CONTROL); (2) feed containing the aflatoxin-contaminated maize (AF); (3) feed containing the aflatoxin-contaminated maize detoxified with NEW (AF + NEW); and (4) control feed containing aflatoxin-free maize treated with NEW (NEW). Compared to the control groups, turkey poults of the AF group significantly reduced body weight gain and increased feed conversion ratio and mortality rate; whereas turkey poults of the AF + NEW group did not present significant differences on productive parameters. In addition, alterations in serum biochemical constituents, enzyme activities, relative organ weight, gross morphological changes and histopathological studies were significantly mitigated by the aflatoxin-detoxification procedure. From these results, it is concluded that the treatment of aflatoxin-contaminated maize with NEW provided reasonable protection against the effects caused by aflatoxins in young turkey poults.

In this study, we hypothesize that systemic delivery of hydrogen saline water may improve the reservation of bone tissue in the tibias and femurs of osteoporotic rats caused by diabetes mellitus (DM), which is characterized by increased levels of oxidative stress and overproducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Methods: The animals were divided into three groups of 12 animals and lavaged with normal saline (normal control and DM), or hydrogen saline water (DM + HRS). General status, blood glucose level, tibial and femoral mechanical strength, and micro-CT scans of the proximal tibia were recorded and analyzed. Results: After 12 weeks, the glucose level was significantly decreased in the DM + HRS group compared with that of the DM group. Micro-CT scans showed that bone volume/total volume, connectivity density, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number were significantly increased compared with the DM group. Mechanical results of energy, stiffness and elastic modulus in the DM + HRS group were significantly higher than in the other groups for the tibia and femur. Conclusions: The results indicate that the systemic delivery of hydrogen saline water, which is safe and well tolerated, preserves bone volume and decreases fracture risks in streptozotocin-induced diabetic status rats, whose bone structure or inherent material properties of bone tissues are changed.

ERW has reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging activity and recent studies demonstrated that hydrogen-dissolved water exhibits ROS-scavenging activity. Thus, the antioxidative capacity of ERW is postulated to be dependent on the presence of hydrogen levels; however, there is no report verifying the role of dissolved hydrogen in ERW. In this report, we clarify whether the responsive factor for antioxidative activity in ERW is dissolved hydrogen. The intracellular ROS scavenging activity of ERW and hydrogen-dissolved water was tested by both fluorescent stain method and immuno spin trapping assay. We confirm that ERW possessed electrolysis intensity-dependent intracellular ROS-scavenging activity, and ERW exerts significantly superior ROS-scavenging activity in HT1080 cells than the equivalent level of hydrogen-dissolved water. ERW retained its ROS-scavenging activity after removal of dissolved hydrogen, but lost its activity when autoclaved. An oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay and chemiluminescence assay could not detect radical-scavenging activity in both ERW and hydrogen-dissolved water.

We investigated the ability of nanoparticle hydrogen in water to suppress hydroxyurea-induced ROS production, cytotoxicity, and the accumulation of β-galactosidase (an indicator of aging), and promote cell proliferation. The accumulation of β-galactosidase in the cytoplasm and the appearance of abnormal nuclei were inhibited by daily treatment of cells with hydrogen water. When the aging process was accelerated by hydroxyurea-induced oxidative stress, the effect of hydrogen water was even more remarkable.

Oxidative stress accounts for dystrophic muscle pathologies in DMD. We examined the effects of molecular hydrogen in mdx mice, a model animal for DMD. Methods: The pregnant mother started to take supersaturated hydrogen water (>5 ppm) ad libitum from E15.5 up to weaning of the offspring. The mdx mice took supersaturated hydrogen water from weaning until age 10 or 24 weeks when they were sacrificed. Results: Hydrogen water prevented abnormal body mass gain that is commonly observed in mdx mice. Hydrogen improved the spontaneous running distance that was estimated by a counter-equipped running-wheel, and extended the duration on the rota-rod. Plasma creatine kinase activities were decreased by hydrogen at ages 10 and 24 weeks. Hydrogen also decreased the number of central nuclei of muscle fibers at ages 10 and 24 weeks, and immunostaining for nitrotyrosine in gastrocnemius muscle at age 24 weeks. Additionally, hydrogen tended to increase protein expressions of antioxidant glutathione peroxidase 1, as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, in skeletal muscle at age 10 weeks. Discussion: Although molecular mechanisms of the diverse effects of hydrogen remain to be elucidated, hydrogen potentially improves muscular dystrophy in DMD patients.

Hydrogen (H2), as an antioxidant, has been shown to have great potentials in preventive and therapeutic applications to the lethal injury that occurs on ischemia-reperfusion. However, H2 is sparingly soluble in water, resulting in its poor bioavailability in blood and damaged tissues. Here, we have developed an ultrasound-visible H2 delivery system by loading H2 inside of microbubbles (H2-MBs) to prevent myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Using this system, the concentrations of H2 in unit volume can be greatly improved under normal temperature and pressure conditions. H2-MBs can be visually tracked with ultrasound imaging systems and can effectively release the therapeutic gas. In vivo systemic delivery of H2-MBs in myocardial ischemic rats at the start of reperfusion resulted in a significant reduction of infarct size and pathological remodeling. Further analysis showed that this approach markedly inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis and reduced myocardial inflammation and oxidant damage in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion rats.

Recently, electrolyzed hydrogen-rich water (H-water) has been shown to act as an effective antioxidant by reducing oxidative stress. In addition to this general health benefit, H-water has antibacterial activity for disease-associated oral bacteria. However, little is known about the effect of H-water on oral bacterial biofilm. The objective of this study was to confirm the effect of H-water on streptococcal biofilm formation. Methods: In vitro streptococcal biofilm was quantified using crystal violet staining after culture on a polystyrene plate. The effect of H-water on the expression of genes involved in insoluble glucan synthesis and glucan binding, which are critical steps for oral biofilm formation, was evaluated in MS. In addition, we compared the number of salivary streptococci after oral rinse with H-water and that with control tap water. Salivary streptococci were quantified by counting viable colonies on Mitis Salivarius agar-bacitracin. Results: Our data showed that H-water caused a significant decrease in in vitro streptococcal biofilm formation. The expression level of the mRNA of glucosyltransferases (gtfB, gtfc, and gtfI) and glucan-binding proteins (gbpC, dblB) were decreased remarkably in MS after H-water exposure for 60s. Furthermore, oral rinse with H-water for 1 week led to significantly fewer salivary streptococci than did that with control tap water. Conclusions: Our data suggest that oral rinse with H-water would be helpful in treating dental biofilm-dependent diseases with ease and efficiency.

However, most clinical trials of dietary antioxidants have failed to produce successful outcomes in treating oxidative stress-induced diseases. Molecular hydrogen (H2) has recently received considerable attention as a therapeutic agent owing to its novel antioxidant properties, a selective scavenger of hydroxyl and peroxynitrite radicals. Beyond this, numerous reports support that H2 can modulate the activity of various cellular signal pathways. However, its effect on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signal pathway, a central regulator of energy hemostasis, has remained almost elusive. Here, we report that hydrogen-rich medium activated LKB1-AMPK signal pathway without ATP depletion, which in turn induced FoxO1-dependent transcription of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Moreover, hydrogen-rich media effectively reduced the level of reactive oxygen species in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide and protected these cells from apoptosis in an AMPK-dependent manner. These results suggest that the LKB1-AMPK-FoxO1 signaling pathway is a critical mediator of the antioxidant properties of H2, further supporting the idea that H2 acts as a signaling molecule to serve various physiological functions.

Finally, HS significantly alleviated isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HS attenuates isoflurane-induced caspase-3 activation and cognitive impairment via inhibition of isoflurane-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduction in ATP levels. These findings warrant further research into the underlying mechanisms of this activity, and indicate that HS has the potential to attenuate anesthesia neurotoxicity.",Positive,Cell Culture,Brain,Neuroprotection,Anesthetic Toxicity (Isoflurane),Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Culture Media,,,China

Methods: To explore the role of the PI3K-Akt pathway in the hepatoprotection of HCH, C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups: Sham, I/R, I/R + HCH, LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) + I/R + HCH, and LY + I/R groups. Mice received inhalation of 66.7% hydrogen and 33.3% oxygen for 1 h immediately after surgery. LY294002 was intravenously injected at 10 mol/kg. To explore whether PI3K-Akt pathway activation was mediated by the A2A receptor, additional four groups were included: ZM241385 (A2A receptor antagonist) + I/R + HCH, ZM241385 + I/R, bpv(HOpic) (PTEN inhibitor) + I/R, and ZM241385 + bpv + I/R + HCH. Six hours after I/R, serum biochemistry, histological examination, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the hepatoprotection of HCH and the role of the PI3K-Akt pathway and A2A receptor in this protection. Results: Liver dysfunction, hepatic pathological injury, infiltration of inflammatory cytokines, and hepatocyte apoptosis were observed after hepatic I/R, accompanied by inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway. HCH significantly improved liver function, reduced serum inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis, and also induced the PI3K-Akt pathway activation. In the presence of LY294002 or ZM241385, the protective effects of HCH were markedly attenuated, but the effects of ZM241385 were reversed by bpv(HOpic).

Methods: Sixty rabbits were randomly divided into two groups (model group and hydrogen group). Osteonecrosis was induced according to an established protocol of steroid-induced ON. Rabbits in the hydrogen group were treated with intraperitoneal injections of molecular hydrogen at 10 ml/kg body weight for seven consecutive days. Plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, soluble thrombomodulin(sTM), glutathione(GSH) and malondialdehyde(MDA) were measured before and after steroid administration. The presence or absence of ON was examined histopathologically. Oxidative injury and vascular injury were assessed in vivo by immunohistochemical staining of 8-hydoxy-2-deoxyguanosine(8-OHdG) and MDA, and ink artery infusion angiography. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed to measure apoptosis. Results: The incidence of steroid-induced ON was significantly lower in hydrogen group (28.6%) than that in model group (68.0%). No statistically differences were observed on the levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides. Oxidative injury, vascular injury and apoptosis were attenuated in the hydrogen group compared with those in the model group in vivo. Conclusions: These results suggested that molecular hydrogen prevents steroid-induced osteonecrosis in rabbits by suppressing oxidative injury, vascular injury and apoptosis.

Molecular hydrogen has antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects and a preventive effect on oxidative stress-induced cell death. In the present study, we investigated solidified hydrogen-occluding-silica (H2-silica) that can release molecular hydrogen into cell culture medium because the use of hydrogen gas has strict handling limitations in hospital and medical facilities and laboratories, owing to its physicochemical characteristics. Human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (KYSE-70) cells and normal human esophageal epithelial cells (HEEpiCs) were used to investigate the effects of H2-silica on cell viability and proliferation. Cell migration was examined with wound healing and culture-insert migration assays. The intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species were evaluated with a nitroblue tetrazolium assay. To assess the apoptotic status of the cells, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and cleaved caspase-3 were analyzed by western blot. The results showed that KYSE-70 cells and HEEpiCs were generally inhibited by H2-silica administration, and there was a significant proliferation-inhibitory effect in an H2-silica concentration-dependent manner compared with the control group (P < 0.05) in KYSE-70. Apoptosis-inducing effect on KYSE-70 cells was observed in 10, 300, 600, and 1,200 ppm H2-silica, and only 1,200 ppm H2-silica caused a 2.4-fold increase in apoptosis in HEEpiCs compared with the control group as the index of Bax/Bcl-2. H2 silica inhibited cell migration in KYSE-70 cells, and high concentrations had a cytotoxic effect on normal cells. These findings should provide insights into the mechanism of inhibition of H2-silica on human cancer cells in vitro.

Methods: In vitro reduction of hydrogen peroxide by HRW was determined with a chemiluminescence system. Female mice were randomly divided into five groups: control, EtOH, EtOH + silymarin, EtOH + HRW and EtOH + silymarin + HRW. Each group was fed a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing EtOH or isocaloric maltose dextrin (control diet). Silymarin was used as a positive control to compare HRW efficacy against chronic EtOH-induced hepatotoxicity. HRW was freshly prepared and given at a dosage of 1.2 mL/mouse trice daily. Blood and liver tissue were collected after chronic-binge liquid-diet feeding for 12 wk. Results: The in vitro study showed that HRW directly scavenged hydrogen peroxide. The in vivo study showed that HRW increased expression of acyl ghrelin, which was correlated with food intake. HRW treatment significantly reduced EtOH-induced increases in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, triglycerol and total cholesterol levels, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6. HRW attenuated malondialdehyde level, restored glutathione depletion and increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities in the liver. Moreover, HRW reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels but increased IL-10 and IL-22 levels. Conclusion: HRW protects against chronic EtOH-induced liver injury, possibly by inducing acyl ghrelin to suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and induce IL-10 and IL-22, thus activating antioxidant enzymes against oxidative stress.

Recent studies have shown that 2% hydrogen or hydrogen water is effective in the treatment and prevention of a variety of diseases. This study investigated the beneficial effects and the possible mechanisms of different hydrogen concentrations on COPD. Methods: A rat COPD model was established through smoke exposure methods, and inhalation of different concentrations of hydrogen was used as the intervention. The daily condition of rats and the weight changes were observed; lung function and right ventricular hypertrophy index were assessed. Also, white blood cells were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Pathologic changes in the lung tissue were analyzed using light microscopy and electron microscopy; cardiovascular structure and pulmonary arterial pressure changes in rats were observed using ultrasonography. Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, IL-23, matrix metalloproteinase-12, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, caspase-3, caspase-8 protein, and mRNA levels in the lung tissue were determined using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The results showed that hydrogen inhalation significantly reduced the number of inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, matrix metalloproteinase-12, caspase-3, and caspase-8, but increased the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 expression. Furthermore, hydrogen inhalation ameliorated lung pathology, lung function, and cardiovascular function and reduced the right ventricular hypertrophy index. Inhalation of 22% and 41.6% hydrogen showed better outcome than inhalation of 2% hydrogen. Conclusion: These results suggest that hydrogen inhalation slows the development of COPD-like lung disease in a cigarette smoke-induced rat model. Higher concentrations of hydrogen may represent a more effective way for the rat model.

Methods: A total of 54 adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into three groups by random number table: namely sham-operated group (sham group), trauma group (TBI group), and trauma + hydrogen-rich water group (TBI+HW group), the rats in each group were subdivided into 1, 3 and 7 days subgroups according to the time points after trauma, with 6 rats in each subgroup. The TBI model was reproduced by using a modified Feency method for free fall impact, and the rats in sham group were not given brain impact after craniotomy. The rats in TBI+HW group were given intraperitoneal injection of hydrogen-rich water (5 mL/kg) after TBI model reproduction, and then once a day until being sacrificed, and the rats in sham group and TBI group were given the same amount of normal saline. The neurological severity scores (NSS) for neurologic deficits were calculated at corresponding time points, and then the rats were sacrificed for brain tissue at 3 mm around lesion boundary. After hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the pathological changes in lesion boundary brain tissue were observed under light microscope. The expression of CD34+ cells was observed by immunohistochemical analysis, which markers were used to count the newborn blood capillary sprouts around the traumatic brain tissue. The protein expression of CD34 was determined by Western Blot. Results: NSS scores at all time points in sham group were 0. NSS scores in TBI and TBI+HW groups showed a decreased tendency with time prolongation after TBI, which showed more significant in TBI+HW group, NSS scores at 3 days and 7 days were significantly lower than those of TBI group (3 day: 8.67±0.52 vs. 11.56±1.94, 7 days: 7.33±0.52 vs. 8.17±0.98, both P < 0.05). Under light microscope, the brain tissue of rats in sham group was normal. After injury, pathological changes in lesion boundary brain tissue in TBI group were characterized by obvious hemorrhagic necrosis, severe brain edema, a large number of degeneration and necrosis of nerve cells and inflammatory cell infiltration, and the pathological changes were more obvious at 3 days. The edema area in TBI+HW group was slightly smaller than that of TBI group, and the surrounding edema was slightly reduced. It was shown by immunohistochemistry that only a very small number of neoformative capillaries were found in sham group. The number of neoformative capillaries in lesion boundary brain tissue was gradually increased with time prolongation in TBI group. The number of neoformative capillaries in TBI+HW group was more significantly, which was significantly higher than that of TBI group at 3 days and 7 days after injury (cells/HP: 10.59±1.88 vs. 8.61±1.22 at 3 days, 23.20±3.16 vs. 17.01±2.64 at 7 days, both P < 0.05). It was shown by Western Blot that the expression of CD34 protein at all time points in TBI group was significantly increased as compared with that of sham group. The expression of CD34 protein at 1 day and 3 days in TBI+HW group was slightly increased as compared with that of TBI group without significant difference, but it was significantly up-regulated at 7 days after injury, which was significantly higher than that of TBI group (gray value: 1.36±0.36 vs. 0.74±0.08, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Hydrogen-rich water promote CD34+ cells home to the site of injured tissue in rats with TBI, is involved in angiogenesis, and improve clinical outcomes during brain functional recovery.

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) on PPAs formation in mice. Material/Methods Adhesions were induced in mice using the cecum rubbing model. The mice were allocated into 4 groups: control sham group without cecum rubbing; PPA group with saline applied intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily after cecum rubbing; PPA+HRS (5) group with 5 ml/kg of HRS applied i.p. daily after cecum rubbing; and PPA+HRS (10) group with 10 ml/kg of HRS applied i.p. daily after cecum rubbing. On the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days after the operation, mice were killed and pathological adhesion bands were quantified to detect the effect of HRS on PPAs formation. Results HRS did not affect PPAs formation on the 1st day, but did make a significant reduction on the 3rd and 7th days.

We investigated whether hydrogen (H2) gas inhalation would influence the tolerance to hemorrhagic shock and improve survival. Methods: Hemorrhagic shock was achieved by withdrawing blood until the mean arterial blood pressure reached 30-35 mm Hg. After 60 minutes of shock, the rats were resuscitated with a volume of normal saline equal to four times the volume of shed blood. The rats were assigned to either the H2 gas (1.3% H2, 26% O2, 72.7% N2)-treated group or the control gas (26% O2, 74% N2)-treated group.

Despite losing more blood, the increase in serum potassium levels was suppressed in the H2 gas-treated rats after 60 minutes of shock. Fluid resuscitation completely restored blood pressure in the H2 gas-treated rats, whereas it failed to fully restore the blood pressure in the control gas-treated rats. At 2 hours after fluid resuscitation, blood pressure remained in the normal range and metabolic acidosis was well compensated in the H2 gas-treated rats, whereas we observed decreased blood pressure and uncompensated metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia in the surviving control gas-treated rats. Conclusions: H2 gas inhalation delays the progression to irreversible shock. Clinically, H2 gas inhalation is expected to stabilize the subject until curative treatment can be performed, thereby increasing the probability of survival after hemorrhagic shock.",Positive,Rat,Whole Body,Shock,Hemorrhagic Shock,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,Japan

Persistence on surfaces and resistance to many conventional disinfectants contribute to widespread transmission of norovirus. We examined the efficacy of neutral electrolyzed water (NEW; pH 7) for inactivation of human NoV GII.4 Sydney in suspension (ASTM method 1052-11) and on stainless steel surfaces (ASTM method 1053-11) with and without an additional soil load. The impact of the disinfectant on viral capsid was assessed using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR; with an RNase pretreatment), SDS-PAGE, transmission electron microscopy, and a histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) receptor-binding assay. These studies were done in parallel with those using Tulane virus (TuV), a cultivable human NoV surrogate. Neutral electrolyzed water at 250 ppm free available chlorine produced a 4.8- and 0.4-log10 reduction in NoV genome copy number after 1 min in suspension and on stainless steel, respectively. Increasing the contact time on surfaces to 5, 10, 15, and 30 min reduced human NoV genomic copies by 0.5, 1.6, 2.4, and 5.0 log10 and TuV infectious titers by 2.4, 3.0, 3.8, and 4.1 log10 PFU, respectively. Increased soil load effectively eliminated antiviral efficacy regardless of testing method and virus. Exposure to NEW induced a near complete loss of receptor binding (5 ppm, 30 s), degradation of VP1 major capsid protein (250 ppm, 5 min), and increased virus particle aggregation (150 ppm, 30 min). Neutral electrolyzed water at 250 ppm shows promise as an antinoroviral disinfectant when used on precleaned stainless steel surfaces.IMPORTANCE Norovirus is the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide. Transmission occurs by fecal-oral or vomitus-oral routes. The persistence of norovirus on contaminated environmental surfaces exacerbates its spread, as does its resistance to many conventional disinfectants. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the antinoroviral efficacy of neutral electrolyzed water (NEW), a novel chlorine-based disinfectant that can be used at reduced concentrations, making it more environmentally friendly and less corrosive than bleach. An industrial-scale electrochemical activation device capable of producing relatively stable electrolyzed water at a wide pH range was used in this study. Experiments showed that 250 ppm NEW effectively eliminated (defined as a 5-log10 reduction) human norovirus GII.4 Sydney (epidemic strain) on clean stainless steel surfaces after a 30-min exposure. Supporting studies showed that, like bleach, NEW causes inactivation by disrupting the virus capsid. This product shows promise as a bleach alternative with antinoroviral efficacy.

Consumption of water nearly saturated with H2 also prevents chronic neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease in animal and clinical studies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the remarkable effect of a small amount of H2 remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of H2 on mitochondria in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. H2 increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and the cellular ATP level, which were accompanied by a decrease in the reduced glutathione level and an increase in the superoxide level. Pretreatment with H2 suppressed H2O2-induced cell death, whereas post-treatment did not. Increases in the expression of anti-oxidative enzymes underlying the Nrf2 pathway in H2-treated cells indicated that mild stress caused by H2 induced increased resistance to exacerbated oxidative stress. We propose that H2 functions both as a radical scavenger and a mitohormetic effector against oxidative stress in cells.

Furthermore, the very small black dots that could inhibit cell proliferation were produced only at pH 3 to 3.5 of EW. Additional experiments showed that this inhibition of proliferation is reversible. These results suggest that the effect of EW on HeLa cells is cytostatic and not cytotoxic.

Recent studies have shown that molecular hydrogen (H2) is biologically active as an anti-inflammatory agent. Thus, we developed a novel hemodialysis (E-HD) system which delivers H2 (30 to 80 ppb)-enriched dialysis solution, to conduct a prospective observational study (UMIN000004857) in order to compare the long-term outcomes between E-HD and conventional-HD (C-HD) in Japan. The present interim analysis aimed to look at potential clinical effects of E-HD during the first 12 months observation. Subjects and method: 262 patients (140, E-HD; 122, C-HD) were subjected for analysis for comprehensive clinical profiles. They were all participating in the above mentioned study, and they had been under the respective HD treatment for 12 consecutive months without hospitalization. Collected data, such as, physical and laboratory examinations, medications, and self-assessment questionnaires on subjective symptoms (i.e., fatigue and pruritus) were compared between the two groups. Results: In a 12-month period, no clinical relevant differences were found in dialysis-related parameters between the two groups. However, there were differences in the defined daily dose of anti-hypertensive agents, and subjective symptoms, such as severe fatigue, and pruritus, which were all less in the E-HD group. Multivariate analysis revealed E-HD was an independent significant factor for the reduced use of anti-hypertensive agents as well as the absence of severe fatigue and pruritus at 12 months after adjusting for confounding factors. Conclusion: The data indicates E-HD could have substantial clinical benefits beyond conventional HD therapy, and support the rationale to conduct clinical trials of H2 application to HD treatment.

However, peritoneal membrane failure remains problematic and constitutes a critical cause of PD discontinuation. Recent studies have revealed the unique biological action of molecular hydrogen (H2) as an anti-oxidant, which ameliorates tissue injury. In the present study, we aimed to examine the effects of H2 on the peritoneal membrane of experimental PD rats. Method Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the following groups (n = 8–11 each) receiving different test solutions: control group (no treatment), PD group (commercially available lactate-based neutral 2.5% glucose PD solution), and H2PD group (PD solution with dissolved H2 at 400 ppb). Furthermore, the influence of iron (FeCl3: 5 μM: inducer of oxidative cellular injury) in the respective PD solutions was also examined (Fe-PD and Fe-H2PD groups). The H2PD solution was manufactured by bathing a PD bag in H2-oversaturated water created by electrolysis of the water. Twenty mL of the test solutions were intraperitoneally injected once a day for 10 days. Parietal peritoneum samples and cells collected from the peritoneal surface following treatment with trypsin were subjected to analysis. Results In the PD group as compared to controls, a mild but significant sub-mesothelial thickening was observed, with increase in the number of cells in the peritoneal surface tissue that were positive for apoptosis, proliferation and vimentin, as seen by immunostaining. There were significantly fewer of such changes in the H2PD group, in which there was a dominant presence of M2 (CD163+) macrophages in the peritoneum. The Fe-PD group showed a significant loss of mesothelial cells with sub-mesothelial thickening, these changes being ameliorated in the Fe-H2PD group. Conclusion H2-dissolved PD solutions could preserve mesothelial cells and peritoneal membrane integrity in PD rats.

Methods: The animals were subjected to transient cochlear ischemia by occluding the bilateral vertebral arteries for l5min. Five milliliters of hydrogen-rich saline was then intravenously administered immediately after the insult. Saline without hydrogen was used as a control. Effects of hydrogen were evaluated using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and histological studies of the inner ear. Results: In non-ischemia animals, ABR thresholds and histological findings of the cochlea did not change by administration of saline or hydrogen-rich saline. In contrast, transient cochlear ischemia caused a 24.2±3.8dB increase in the ABR threshold at 8kHz, and a decrease of 14.1%±1.8% in the number of inner hair cells (IHCs) at the basal turn on day 7. Ischemic damage was more severe at 16 and 32kHz. When the animals were treated with hydrogen-rich saline, cochlear damage was significantly reduced: the increase in ABR threshold was 11.7±2.6dB at 8kHz and the IHC loss was 7.5%±2.1% at the basal turn on day 7. The effects of hydrogen-rich saline were more prominent at higher frequencies. Conclusions: Intravenous administration of hydrogen-rich saline was effective in preventing acute hearing loss due to transient cochlear ischemia.

Recent studies demonstrated that oxidative stress might be involved in HBL. However, whether the antioxidants proanthocyanidin (PA) or hydrogen water (HW) can ameliorate HBL remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of PA and HW on HBL. Materials and methods: A rat HBL model was established through administration of linoleic acid with or without treatment with PA or HW. The levels of hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC) count, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), and ferryl Hb were measured. Results: RBC and Hb values as well as the activity of SOD and GSH-PX were reduced after administration of linoleic acid, which was ameliorated by treatment with PA or HW. In addition, the quantity of MDA was significantly decreased with the administration of PA or HW. Conclusion: PA and HW could ameliorate HBL in a rat model by reducing oxidative stress, suggesting that they might be used as a novel therapeutic approach in the prophylaxis or treatment of HBL in clinics.

To determine whether hydrogen could protect mice from cGVHD in an MHC-incompatible murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model, survival rates of mice were calculated, and skin lesions were also evaluated after BMT. This article demonstrated that administration of hydrogen-rich saline increased survival rate of cGVHD mice. Administration of hydrogen-rich saline after transplantation also reduced skin lesions of cGVHD mice. Previously, we reported the therapeutic effects of hydrogen on acute GVHD. However, there was no report on the therapeutic effects of hydrogen on cGVHD mice. It is suggested that hydrogen has a potential as an effective and safe therapeutic agent on cGVHD.

The main bacteria in chronic periodontitis is Porphyromonas gingivalis. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a pathogen associated with aggressive periodontitis, initiates a proinflammatory response that causes tissue destruction of periodontal, alveolar bone resorption and subsequent tooth loss. Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) is an alkaline water, ERW not only has a high pH and low oxidation reduction potential (ORP), but also contains several magnesium ions. Magnesium ions proven effective for the prevention of various diseases. Purpose: To analyze the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in Wistar rats with cases of chronic and aggressive periodontitis that consumed ERW. Method: Wistar rats were divided into four groups, each group with 10 rats. The first and second group were Wistar rat with chronic periodontitis and consume drinking water and ERW. The third and fourth group were Wistar rat with aggressive periodontitis and consume drinking water and ERW. This experiment is done by calculating the levels of MDA. The calculation of the levels of MDA is done with spectrophotometric assay for MDA. Result: The results of this experiment show that the level of MDA in serum in group that consume ERW had decreased significantly different with thegroup that consume drinking water with the statistical test.

Methods: Male mice were randomly divided into the following four groups: control group, in which the mice received equivalent volumes of normal saline (NS) intraperitoneally (ip); dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) group, in which the mice received NS ip (5 mL/kg body weight, twice per day at 8 am and 5 pm) for 7 consecutive days after IBD modeling; DSS + HRW group, in which the mice received HRW (in the same volume as the NS treatment) for 7 consecutive days after IBD modeling; and DSS + HRW + ZnPP group, in which the mice received HRW (in the same volume as the NS treatment) and ZnPP [a heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor, 25 mg/kg] for 7 consecutive days after IBD modeling. IBD was induced by feeding DSS to the mice, and blood and colon tissues were collected on the 7th d after IBD modeling to determine clinical symptoms, colonic inﬂammation and the potential mechanisms involved. Results: The DSS + HRW group exhibited significantly attenuated weight loss and a lower extent of disease activity index compared with the DSS group on the 7th d (P < 0.05). HRW exerted protective effects against colon shortening and colonic wall thickening in contrast to the DSS group (P < 0.05). The histological study demonstrated milder inflammation in the DSS + HRW group, which was similar to normal inflammatory levels, and the macroscopic and microcosmic damage scores were lower in this group than in the DSS group (P < 0.05). The oxidative stress parameters, including MDA and MPO in the colon, were significantly decreased in the DSS + HRW group compared with the DSS group (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, the protective indicators, superoxide dismutase and glutathione, were markedly increased with the use of HRW. Inflammatory factors were assessed, and the results showed that the DSS + HRW group exhibited significantly reduced levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β compared with the DSS group (P < 0.05). In addition, the pivotal proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, including p-eIF2α, ATF4, XBP1s and CHOP, were dramatically reduced after HRW treatment in contrast to the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, HRW treatment markedly up-regulated HO-1 expression, and the use of ZnPP obviously reversed the protective role of HRW. In the DSS + HRW + ZnPP group, colon shortening and colonic wall thickening were significantly aggravated, and the macroscopic damage scores were similar to those of the DSS + HRW group (P < 0.05). The histological study also showed more serious colonic damage that was similar to the DSS group. Conclusion: HRW has a significant therapeutic potential in IBD by inhibiting inflammatory factors, oxidative stress and ER stress and by up-regulating HO-1 expression.

Nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and proinflammatory cytokine levels were detected using western blot analysis. The data showed that the spatial recognition memory and fear memory of the rats treated with sevoflurane decreased compared with the control, and the cognitive function of the rats treated with sevoflurane and hydrogen gas significantly increased in comparison with treatment with sevoflurane alone. Moreover, hydrogen gas suppressed NF-κB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation and reduced the production of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α following sevoflurane administration. Thus, the results proposed that hydrogen gas might protect against sevoflurane neurotoxicity by inhibiting NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine release, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for anesthesia neurotoxicity.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) that took a lot of attention was diabetes mellitus. In Indonesia diabetes mellitus is a serious threat to health development. Efforts developed to overcome the problems of diabetes mellitus type 2 is to apply four pillars of therapy namely education, nutrition therapy, physical activity and pharmacology. However, these efforts have not been able to achieve optimal results due to many obstacles encountered. One of the non-pharmacological treatments that can be utilized is to consume alkaline water to reduce blood sugar levels in diabetes mellitus type 2. Methods: The research design used was quasy experiment with pre-post control group design approach. The variables observed in this study were random blood sugar changes in people with diabetes mellitus type 2 prior to intervention and after intervention. Intervention is given over a period of 14 days. To measure the demand of drinking water on the respondents, the measurement was done using Water Drink Reminder - Hydro application. The alkaline water used in this study is alkaline water produced from Kangen Water Type SD501 Platinum Machine. Test analysis used is paired t test to determine the effectiveness of alkaline water consumption to decrease random blood sugar level of diabetes mellitus type 2. To know the difference of effectiveness of alkaline water consumption to decrease of blood sugar level, it uses one way anova test with significance value α: 0.05. Results: From result of the one way anova test with significance value α: 0.05, we have got significance 0.039. Since the significance probability value is 0.039 < 0.05, the research hypothesis is accepted which means that there is a significant difference in the level of random blood sugar of diabetes mellitus type 2 performed by using four kinds of intervention of alkaline water treatment (Alkali Water PH 7.0, PH 8.0, PH 9.5 and PH 9.5 and PH 11.5) for a period of 14 days. Conclusion: Support from health personnel and adherence to diabetes mellitus is required to utilize alkaline water as nonpharmacologic therapy to control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. To achieve maximum results from nonfarmakologi therapy performed, people with diabetes mellitus type 2 should routinely consume antidiabetic drugs provided by health personnel and always strive for a healthy life.

H2 also regulates gene expression involved in intracellular signaling and metabolic pathways. However, it is unclear whether H2 affects gene expression directly or through indirect effects as a consequence of health improvement. Therefore, we attempted to identify genes that exhibit similar changes in expression in response to H2 by employing DNA microarrays and gene set enrichment analysis to analyze RNA from liver and lung of rats and mice with or without dietary stress. We found that H2 activated the expression of sets of genes regulated by histone H3K27 methylation status. H2 also modified the expression of many genes regulated by a wide variety of signaling pathways. RT-qPCR showed that H2 up-regulated expression of Kcnc3, a H3K27-regulated gene, in organs such as liver, lung, kidney and brain. Furthermore, using immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis, we observed changes in H3K27 methylation status in the liver of mice and rats administered H2. Moreover, we showed that H2 simultaneously induced the H3K27 demethylase, Jmjd3, and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-related genes. Recently, alteration of mitochondrial function was shown to cause induction of H3K27 demethylase or chromatin restructuring, followed by mtUPR activation through the alteration of H3K27 or H3K9 methylation states. Taken together, our study suggests that H2 can induce beneficial effects through mtUPR activation via epigenetic histone modification and by modification of gene expression.

Hydrogen could significantly reduce HALI by reducing lung edema and apoptosis, inhibiting the elevating of ERS and increased SIRT1 expression. By inhibition of SIRT1 expression, the effect of hydrogen on prevention of HALI is significantly weakened, the inhibition of the ERS was also reversed. Our findings indicate that hydrogen could reduce HALI related ERS, and the mechanism of hydrogen may be associated with upregulation of SIRT1, this study reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of hydrogen, which provides a new theoretical basis for clinical application of hydrogen.",Positive,Rat,Lung,Surgery/Transplantation,Hyperoxia,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,Oxygen,China

Oxidants derived from CS can induce DNA damage and stress-induced premature cellular senescence in the respiratory system, which play significant roles in COPD. Therefore, antioxidants should provide benefits for the treatment of COPD; however, their therapeutic potential remains limited owing to the complexity of this disease. Recently, molecular hydrogen (H2) has been reported as a preventive and therapeutic antioxidant. Molecular H2 can selectively reduce hydroxyl radical accumulation with no known side effects, showing potential applications in managing oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolism. However, there have been no reports on the efficacy of molecular H2 in COPD patients. In the present study, we used a mouse model of COPD to investigate whether CS-induced histological damage in the lungs could be attenuated by administration of molecular H2. We administered H2-rich pure water to senescence marker protein 30 knockout (SMP30-KO) mice exposed to CS for 8 weeks. Administration of H2-rich water attenuated the CS-induced lung damage in the SMP30-KO mice and reduced the mean linear intercept and destructive index of the lungs. Moreover, H2-rich water significantly restored the static lung compliance in the CS-exposed mice compared with that in the CS-exposed H2-untreated mice. Moreover, treatment with H2-rich water decreased the levels of oxidative DNA damage markers such as phosphorylated histone H2AX and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and senescence markers such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1, and β-galactosidase in the CS-exposed mice. These results demonstrated that H2-rich pure water attenuated CS-induced emphysema in SMP30-KO mice by reducing CS-induced oxidative DNA damage and premature cell senescence in the lungs. Our study suggests that administration of molecular H2 may be a novel preventive and therapeutic strategy for COPD.

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of immersing lungs in hydrogen-rich saline on lung IRI. Methods: Lewis rats were divided into three groups: (i) sham, (ii) normal saline and (iii) hydrogen-rich saline. In the first experiment, the left thoracic cavity was filled with either normal saline or hydrogen-rich saline for 1 h. Then, we measured the hydrogen concentration in the left lung using a sensor gas chromatograph ( N = 3 per group). In the second experiment, lung IRI was induced by occlusion of the left pulmonary hilum for 1 h, followed by reperfusion for 3 h. During the ischaemic period, the left thoracic cavity was filled with either normal saline or hydrogen-rich saline. After reperfusion, we assessed lung function, histological changes and cytokine production ( N = 5-7 per group). Results: Immersing lungs in hydrogen-rich saline resulted in an elevated hydrogen concentration in the lung (6.9 ± 2.9 μmol/1 g lung). After IRI, pulmonary function (pulmonary compliance and oxygenation levels) was significantly higher in the hydrogen-rich saline group than in the normal saline group ( P < 0.05). Similarly, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin-1β and interleukin-6) in the left lung were significantly lower in the hydrogen-rich saline group than in the normal saline group ( P < 0.05). Conclusions: Immersing lungs in hydrogen-rich saline delivered hydrogen into the lung and consequently attenuated lung IRI.

The present study explored the protective effects of hydrogen rich saline (HRS) against the photoreceptor degeneration in the N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) administrated rat, a pharmacologically induced RP model. The therapeutic effects of intraperitoneal (IP) and intravitreous (IV) injections of HRS on regional retina was quantified via topographic measurements. The MNU administrated rats received IV or IP injections of HRS, and then they were subjected to electroretinography, multi electrode array, histological and immunohistochemistry examinations. The concentrations of the retinal malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the mRNA levels of apoptotic-associated genes were quantified. The IP and IV delivery pathways of HRS were both effective to ameliorate MNU induced photoreceptor degeneration. Moreover, the IV acted as a more efficient delivery method than the IP in terms of therapeutic effects. Particularly, the topographic measurements suggested that the IV delivery of HRS could alleviate MNU induced photoreceptor degeneration in the posterior retina. The immunostaining experiments also verified the comparative efficiency between IV and IP delivery of HRS on regional cone photoreceptors. Focal cone photoreceptors showed different susceptibilities to HRS and exhibited as a distinct spatial disequilibrium: cone photoreceptors in the ST quadrant were preferentially rescued; meanwhile, HRS induced protection was feeblest in the IN quadrant. Furthermore, the HRS treatment increased the level of retinal SOD, while reduce the level of retinal MDA in MNU administered rats. The expression levels of sever apoptotic -associated genes were significantly altered by HRS treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that the IV space is an excellent target for HRS delivery. The IV delivery of HRS can efficiently alleviate the photoreceptors (especially these locate at the posterior retina) from MNU toxicity and act as a candidate treatment for RP.",Positive,Rat,Eye,Retinal Injury,Retinitis Pigmentosa,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

Cognitive function was subsequently assessed using Morris water-maze (MWM) test. TNF-α and IL-1β levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry, along with NF-κB activity determined by ELISA. The morphology of hippocampal tissues were further observed by HE staining. Learning and memory abilities of mice were significantly impaired at day 10 and day 14 post-surgery, as partial hepatectomy significantly prolonged the escape latency, decreased time at the original platform quadrant and frequency of crossing in group P when compared to group C (p < 0.05). The surgery also increased the contents of TNF-α, IL-1β, and NF-κB activity at all time points after surgery (p < 0.05).

Moreover, such treatment also decreased TNF-α and IL-1β levels and NF-κB activity (p < 0.05). In addition, cell necrosis in the hippocampus induced by hepatectomy was also rescued by hydrogen-rich saline.

The expression levels of representative five microRNA (miRNAs) (miR-103, miR-488, miR-136, miR-505 and miR-148a) in liver tissues were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The target of miR-136 was validated by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and pull-down assay. MiR-136, MEG3 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression levels following cell treatment were detected in hepatocytes using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Moreover, cell viability and TG content were conducted. MiR-136 was downregulated, MEG3 as well as Nrf2 was upregulated and serum lipid level was reduced in NAFLD mice model after HHW treatment, which exerted the same effect in cellular model. RIP and RNA pull-down assay confirmed that MEG2 was a downstream target of miR-136. What's more, HHW ameliorated lipid accumulation by regulating miR-136/MEG3/Nrf2 axis in vitro and in vivo.

In this study, the authors investigated the therapeutic effects of hydrogen gas on skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury. Methods: The authors compared the concentration of hydrogen in a muscle on intraperitoneal administration of hydrogen-rich saline and on inhalation of hydrogen gas. Animals were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. Mice were treated with inhalation of hydrogen gas, and the hind gastrocnemius muscle was collected. Muscle morphology and inflammatory change were evaluated after ischemia-reperfusion. Moreover, a footprint test was performed to assess the functional effect of hydrogen. Results: Hydrogen concentration of tissue was significantly higher, and the elevated level was maintained longer by hydrogen gas inhalation than by intraperitoneal administration of hydrogen-rich saline. Infarct zone and area with loss of tissue structure and marked cellular infiltration were significantly decreased in groups treated by hydrogen gas inhalation during ischemia-reperfusion; however, these effects were not observed by posttreatment of hydrogen. One week after ischemia-reperfusion, mice that had been pretreated with hydrogen gas recovered faster and achieved smoother walking in appearance compared with mice in the other groups as assessed by the footprint test.

In the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal procedure, the mice were treated with three HRS (20 μg/kg, i.p.) injections, and naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was given 30 min after HRS administration. Body weight, jumping behavior and wet-dog shakes were immediately assessed. In the spontaneous withdrawal procedure, the mice were treated with HRS (20 μg/kg, i.p.) every 8-h. Mice underwent naloxone-precipitated or spontaneous withdrawal were tested for anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and light/dark box (L/D box) paradigm, respectively.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) elicits ROS that induces skin aging through oxidation of proteins, forming disulfide bridges with cysteine or methionine sulfhydryl groups. Decreased Ca2+ signaling is observed in aged cells, probably secondary to the formation of disulfide bonds among Ca2+ signaling-related proteins. Skin aging processes are modeled by treating keratinocytes with H2O2. In the present study, H2O2 dose-dependently impaired the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced Ca2+ response, which was partially protected via co-treatment with β-mercaptoethanol, resulting in reduced disulfide bond formation in inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Molecular hydrogen (H2) was found to be more effectively protected H2O2-induced IP3R1 dysfunction by reducing disulfide bonds, rather than quenching ROS.

Eighteen guinea pigs were randomly divided into three groups (control group/AR group/AR-HRS group). The guinea pigs were injected with hydrogen-rich saline (AR-HRS group) for 10 days after sensitization. The control group was injected with an equal volume of normal saline. The number of sneezes, degree of runny nose, and nasal-rubbing movements were scored. Peripheral blood eosinophil count was recorded. The proportions of Th1/Th2 of the peripheral blood and the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+T cells in the CD4+T cells of the spleen and peripheral blood were determined by flow cytometry. The content of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in the serum was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein and mRNA expression of Foxp3, IL-10, and TGF-β were determined by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR analysis, respectively. Scores of symptoms, number of eosinophils,and nasal mucosa damage were dramatically reduced after HRS treatment. HRS increased the expression of Foxp3, IL-10, TGF-β, and number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Treg cells, which were reduced in AR. HRS also revised the dysregulation of Th1/Th2 balance. Both the number and biological activity of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Treg cells increased with up-regulation of Th1/Th2 after HRS administration.

Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of uveitis and endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). In this study, we investigated whether HRS can mitigate EIU in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into Norm group, Model group, HRS group, dexamethasone (DEX) group, and rats in the latter three groups were injected with equal amount of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce EIU of different severities (by 1 mg/kg of LPS, or 1/8 mg/kg of LPS). Rats in HRS group were injected with HRS intraperitoneally at three different modes to purse an ameliorating effect of EIU (10 mL/kg of HRS immediately after injection of 1 mg/kg of LPS, 20 mL/kg of HRS once a day for 1 week before injection of 1 mg/kg of LPS and at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 8, 12 hours after LPS administration, or 20 mL/kg of HRS once a day for 1 week before injection of 1/8 mg/kg of LPS, and at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours and once a day for 3 weeks after LPS administration). Rats of DEX group were injected with 1 mL/kg of DEX solution intraperitoneally immediately after LPS administration. Rats in Norm and Model groups did not receive any treatment. All rats were examined under slit lamp microscope and graded according to the clinical signs of uveitis. Electroretinogram, quantitative analysis of protein in aqueous humor (AqH) and histological examination of iris and ciliary body were also carried out. Our results showed that HRS did not obviously ameliorate the signs of uveitis under slit lamp examination and the inflammatory cells infiltration around iris and cilliary body of EIU induced by 1 mg/kg or 1/8 mg/kg of LPS (P > 0.05), while DEX significantly reduced the inflammation reflected by the above two indicators (P < 0.05).

Methods: Rats were divided into norm (N) group, model (M) group and HRS (H) group. Rats in M and H groups were given saline and HRS respectively prior to and after administration of MNU. At one day (d1) and d3 afterwards, electroretinogram and histological examination were performed to confirm the effects of HRS on retinal function and structure of MNU-induced RP. Immunofluorescence staining of anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), a maker of microglia cells, was performed, with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for its mRNA quantification. Moreover, Sirt1 mRNA and protein expression in the retinas were detected by Western blot and qRT-PCR. Results: HRS preserved the retinal function and mitigated the reduction of photoreceptor degeneration in MNU-treated retinas. The presence of microglia cells was somewhat more obvious in H group than that in M group at d1. HRS suppressed the further activation of microglia cells, with the number of microglia cells less than that of M group at d3. Results of qRT-PCR of Iba1 were consistent with those of immunofluorescence staining, with the mRNA expression of Iba1 in H group more intensive than that of M group at d1 (P<0.05), while less than that of M group at d3 (P<0.05). Furthermore, the Sirt1 mRNA and protein expression decreased after MNU administration, while HRS mitigated the MNU-induced downregulation of Sirt1.

Oxidative stress serves an important role in cardiac remodeling and heart failure independent of etiological factors. The application of hydrogen as an antioxidant is a novel concept in disease treatment, however no studies as present have investigated the effects of hydrogen on cardiac fibrosis. In the present study, the effects of hydrogen on pressure overload‑induced cardiac fibrosis and heart failure were investigated in abdominal aortic‑constricted rats. Masson's trichrome staining and echocardiography were used to evaluate the fibrotic area and cardiac function, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content was detected by immunofluorescence. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and hydroxyproline content were measured by spectrophotometry. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), NADPH oxidases (NOX)2, NOX4, p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Smad2/3. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the mRNA expression of collagen I (Col I) and fibronectin 1 (FN1). Hydrogen-containing saline (HCS) treatment was observed to improve interstitial fibrosis and cardiac function and to decrease the level of ROS, the oxidative‑stress marker MDA and expression of NOXs, while increasing the activity of the anti‑oxidant enzyme SOD. HCS treatment also decreased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Smad2/3, and the expression of TGF‑β1 and CTGF, which were accompanied by reduced hydroxyproline content, Col I and FN1 mRNA levels. These results indicate that HCS treatment can improve cardiac function by reducing interstitial fibrosis in pressure‑overloaded rats through its anti‑oxidative properties and via suppression of TGF-β1 signaling.",Positive,Rat,Heart,Hypertension,Fibrosis,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

Three hours after the injection with OA, the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2), and bicarbonate (HCO3⁻) levels were analyzed using blood gas analyzer. In addition, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured by commercial kits, and pathological changes of lung tissue were examined by HE staining. Finally, the correlations of MPO activity or MDA level with the levels of TNF-α or IL-1β were analyzed by Pearson’s correlation analysis. Results We found decreased PaO2 levels and the pathological changes of lung tissue of ALI after OA injection. In addition, OA increased the levels of MDA, TNF-α, and IL-1β, as well as MPO activity in lung tissues (P < 0.05). However, after treatment with HSS, all of these changes were alleviated (P < 0.05), and these changes were mitigated when treated with HSS by ip then iv injection (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MDA level and MPO activity were positively correlated with TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the lung tissue, respectively (P < 0.01).

In our previous report, the neuroprotective effect of drinking water with saturated H2 (H2 water) in PD mice might be due to stomach-brain interaction via release of gastric hormone, ghrelin. In the present study, we assessed the effect of H2-induced ghrelin more precisely. To confirm the contribution of ghrelin in H2 water-drinking PD model mice, ghrelin-knock out (KO) mice were used. Despite the speculation, the effect of H2 water was still observed in ghrelin-KO PD model mice. To further check the involvement of ghrelin, possible contribution of ghrelin-induced vagal afferent effect was tested by performing subdiaphragmatic vagotomy before treating with H2 water and administration of MPTP (1-methyl- 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). The protective effect of H2 water was still observed in the vagotomized mice in substantia nigra, suggesting that stimulation of vagal afferent nerves is not involved in H2-induced neuroprotection. Other neuroprotective substitutes in ghrelin-KO mice were speculated because H2-induced neuroprotection was not cancelled by ghrelin receptor antagonist, D-Lys3 GHRP-6, in ghrelin-KO PD model mice, unlike in wild-type PD model mice. Our results indicate that ghrelin may not be the only factor for H2-induced neuroprotection and other factors can substitute the role of ghrelin when ghrelin is absent, raising intriguing options of research for H2-responsive factors.

Hydrogen, emerging as a novel antioxidant, has been proven effective in selectively reducing ROS in animals models of oxidative damage. We herein aim to verify protective effects of hydrogen on eosinophils cells in guinea pigs models of AR. Methods: Thirty two guinea pigs were random divided into four groups, and AR model was established through ovalbumin sensitization. The guinea pigs were injected with hydrogen-rich saline (Normal-HRS and AR-HRS group) or normal saline (control and AR group). The frequencies of sneezing and scratching were recorded. The IgE level, blood eosinophil count and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) level in serum were measured. The serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assays were also measured to evaluate oxidative stress. The expression levels of eotaxin mRNA and protein in the nasal mucosa were also determined by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. Results: HRS reduced the ROS and MDA levels and increased SOD level in guinea pigs of AR-HRS group accompanied with decreased frequency of sneezing and scratches. Meanwhile, there was a decline of the number of eosinophils cells in blood and of thelevel of ECP in serum in the AR-HRS group. HRS also significantly decreased the expression of eotaxin in nasal mucosa. Conclusion: HRS may play a protective role in attenuating allergic inflammation, and suppressing the increase and activation of eosinophils in AR possibly through antioxidation effect of hydrogen.

Male Nrf2 knockout mice (Nrf2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were randomized into four groups: sham, sham+H2, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and CLP+H2. The survival rate was observed and recorded within 7 days, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, HMGB1), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, and catalase ), and oxidative products (MDA, 8-iso-PGF2α) were detected in the serum and intestine using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Previous studies have indicated that oxidative stress is a key factor in the development of NAFLD. Molecular hydrogen (H2) may ameliorate oxidative stress injuries by selectively neutralizing peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radicals. The present study evaluated the effects of H2 on NAFLD in rats and concluded that H2‑rich saline had significant therapeutic effects on NAFLD induced by hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, as demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase‑mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining. H2‑rich saline improved fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and lowered the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin‑1 beta, 3‑nitrotyrosine and 8‑hydroxy‑2'‑deoxyguanosine in the liver. In addition, the present study revealed that H2‑rich saline could significantly increase peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor (PPAR) α and PPARγ expression in hepatocytes. In conclusion, H2‑rich saline may significantly improve NAFLD, possibly by reducing oxidative stress and activating hepatic PPARα and PPARγ expression.

HW specifically decreased hydroxyl radical (∙OH) levels in the c-kit+ cells of 4 Gy irradiated mice. Proliferative bone marrow cells (BMCs) increased and apoptotic c-kit+ cells decreased in irradiated mice uptaken with HW. In addition, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of γ-H2AX and percentage of 8-oxoguanine positive cells significantly decreased in HW-treated c-kit+ cells, indicating that HW can alleviate TBI-induced DNA damage and oxidative DNA damage in c-kit+ cells. Finally, the cell cycle (P21), cell apoptosis (BCL-XL and BAK), and oxidative stress (NRF2, HO-1, NQO1, SOD, and GPX1) proteins were significantly altered by HW in irradiated mouse c-kit+ cells.

Here, we evaluated whether subcutaneous injection of H2 shows enhanced efficacy against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) induced in mice by a high-fat diet and low dose streptozotocin (STZ) treatment. Material and methods: H2 was injected subcutaneously at a dose of 1ml/mouse/week for four weeks. T2DM associated parameters were then evaluated to determine the effectiveness of subcutaneous H2 administration. Results: The body weight of H2 -treated mice did not change over the course of the experiment. Compared to the untreated control animals, glucose, insulin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) levels in serum were significantly lower in treated mice, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) in the serum was significantly higher. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were both improved in H2 -treated mice. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) analysis showed significant reductions in urine volume, urinary total protein and β2 microglobulin, kidney/body weight ratio and kidney fibrosis associated with subcutaneous injection of H2 . Conclusions: Subcutaneous injection of H2 significantly improves T2DM and DN related outcomes in a mouse model, supporting further consideration of subcutaneous injection as a novel and effective route of clinical H2 administration.

The aim of the present study is to determine the effect of hydrogen on cardiomyocyte autophagy during β‑adrenoceptor activation in vivo and in vitro. We prepared hydrogen‑rich medium, and the concentration of hydrogen was measured by using the MB‑Pt reagent method. For the in vitro study, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were stimulated with isoproterenol (ISO; 10 µM) for 5, 15 and 30 min, and then the protein expression levels of the autophagy marker microtubule‑associated protein 1 light chain 3β II (LC3B II) were examined by western blotting. The effect of hydrogen‑rich medium was then tested by pretreating the H9c2 cardiomyocytes with hydrogen‑rich medium for 30 min, then stimulating with ISO, and examining the protein expression levels of the autophagy marker LC3B II. For the in vivo study, mice received hydrogen (1 ml/100 g/day, by intraperitoneal injection) for 7 days prior to ISO administration (0.5 mg/100 g/day, by subcutaneous injection), and subsequently received hydrogen with or without ISO for another 7 days. Hypertrophic responses were examined by heart weight (HW) and heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) measurements. The protein expression of autophagy markers Beclin1, autophagy‑related protein 7 (Atg7) and LC3B II were examined. The results demonstrated that excessive autophagy occurred following 5 min of ISO stimulation in vitro. This enhanced autophagy was blocked by pretreatment with hydrogen‑rich medium. Furthermore, hydrogen improved the deteriorated hypertrophic responses and inhibited the enhanced autophagic activity mediated by ISO administration in vivo, as indicated by decreasing HW and HW/BW, and suppressing the protein expression levels of Beclin1, Atg7 and LC3B II.

Materials and methods: Aerated aqueous solutions of calf thymus DNA were exposed to a (60)Co source at doses ranging from 0 to 55 Gy under normoxic conditions, in the presence or not of 0.7 MPa hydrogen or helium. The measurement of several modified bases was performed using HPLC associated with electrospray ionization tandem pass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Bleaching of aqueous solutions of p-nitrosodimethylaniline (p-NDA) solutions was also used to allow the quantification of hydroxyl radical (•OH) formation. Results: pNDA bleaching was significantly reduced in the presence of hyperbaric hydrogen. This is undoubtedly due to (•)OH scavenging by H2 since, under the same conditions, He had no effect. Similarly, base alterations were significantly reduced in the presence of hydrogen, as compared to controls under normal atmosphere or in the presence of helium. The relative proportions of modified nucleobases were not changed, showing that the only effect of H2 is to scavenge (•)OH without exhibiting reducing properties. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that H2 exerts a significant protection against radiation-induced DNA base damage in aqueous solutions, (•)OH scavenging being the only mechanism involved.

The present study was designed to investigate whether hydrogen-rich saline (HS) attenuates HIBD in neonatal mice and whether the observed protection is associated with reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and regulated autophagy. The results showed that HS treatment significantly improved brain edema and decreased infarct volume. Furthermore, HS significantly attenuated HIBD-induced ER stress responses, including the decreased expression of glucose-regulated protein 78, C/EBP homologous protein, and down-regulated transcription factor. Additionally, we demonstrated that HS induced autophagy, including increased LC3B and Beclin-1 expression and decreased phosphorylation of mTOR and Stat3, as well as phosphorylation of ERK.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been recognized as the crucial contributor to the retinal photoreceptor apoptosis seen in MNU-treated rats. In the present study, we explored the therapeutic effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS), a selective ROS scavenger, on MNU-induced photoreceptor degeneration. Intraperitoneal (IP)administration of HRS ameliorated MNU-induced photoreceptor degeneration in terms of morphology and function: Sharply decreased thickness of the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) and flattened photopic and scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) waveforms, typically seen in response to MNU treatment, were substantially rescued in rats cotreated with MNU and HRS (MNU + HRS). Moreover, the terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed a smaller number of apoptotic photoreceptors in the MNU + HRS group compared that in the MNU group. Compared to MNU-treated rats, retinal malondialdehyde (MDA) content in MNU + HRS rats significantly decreased while superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity significantly increased. Morphological and multi-electrode array (MEA) analyses revealed more efficient preservation of the architecture and field potential waveforms in particularly the peripheral regions of the retinas within the MNU + HRS group, compared to that in the MNU group. However, this enhanced protection of structure and function in the peripheral retina is unlikely the result of site-dependent variation in the efficacy of HRS; rather, it is most likely due to reduced susceptibility of peripheral photoreceptors to MNU-induced degeneration. Inner retinal neuron function in the MNU + HRS rats was better preserved, with fewer apoptotic photoreceptors in the ONL.

Methods: Ninety male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, TBI model group, hydrogen-rich water treatment group (H group),with 30 rats in each group. TBI model was reproduced by weight dropping method. The skulls of rats in sham operation group underwent only craniotomy without direct hit and with bone wax sealed suture.5 mL/kg of hydrogen-rich water injection was given intraperitoneally after model reproduction in H group, and equal amount of normal saline was given in sham and TBI groups, once a day for both groups for 5 days. Six rats from each group were sacrificed at 6,12,24,48 hours and 5 days after evaluating neurological severity scores (NSS).The cerebral cortex was harvested, and the pathological changes in morphology of brain tissue were observed with light microscope. The positive expression of AQP1 in cerebral cortex was observed with immunohistochemistry by light microscopy, the AQP1 mRNA expression in cerebral cortex was determined by real-time fluorescent quantization reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),and the AQP1 protein expression in cerebral cortex was determined by Western Blot. Results: ① All rats in sham operation group had a NSS of zero at each time point. NSS of TBI group was obviously raised with time prolongation, and peaked at 24 hours followed by a lower tendency, while the score in H group was significantly lower than that of TBI group, and the difference was the most obvious at 24 hours as compared with TBI group (9.83 ± 2.78 vs.13.50± 2.42,P ＜ 0.05).② It was shown by light microscope that in the TBI group there were pathological changes in cerebral cortex, including obvious irregular arrangement of nerve cells, cerebral edema, obvious bleeding, especially at 24 hours, then the cerebral edema became vanished gradually; and the positive expression of AQP1 in the pia mater at all the time points in the TBI group was significantly increased, and it was most obvious at 24 hours. Compared with TBI group, the pathological changes at time points of 12 hours to 5 days in H group was significantly lessened, and the positive expression of AQP1 in the cerebral pia mater was reduced obviously.③ Compared with sham operation group, the mRNA and protein expressions of AQP1 in cerebral cortex in TBI group were significantly elevated, peaked at 24 hours [AQP1 mRNA (2-△△Ct):7.50±0.26 vs.1,AQP1 protein (gray value):1.986±0.110 vs.0.336±0.034, both P ＜ 0.05], then they gradually declined. The mRNA and protein expressions of AQP1 in cerebral cortex were significantly decreased after hydrogen-rich water treatment [24-hour AQP1 mRNA (2-△△Ct):5.40±0.21 vs.7.50±0.26, 24-hour AQP1 protein (gray value): 1.246±0.137 vs.1.986±0.110, both P ＜ 0.05]. Conclusions: The up-regulation of AQP1 mRNA and protein in rats' cerebral cortex after TBI perhaps participates in edema formation which might be involved in the pathophysiology of cerebral edema in TBI. Early treatment with an intraperitoneally injection of hydrogen-rich water is capable of attenuating the extent of TBI-induced up-regulation of AQP1 mRNA and protein, alleviating cerebral edema, and achieving its protective effects.

Electrolyzed Reduced Water (ERW) produced near the cathode during water electrolysis exhibits high pH, high concentration of dissolved hydrogen and an extremely negative redox potential. Several findings indicate that ERW had the ability of a scavenger free radical, which results from hydrogen molecules with a high reducing ability and may participate in the redox regulation of cellular function. We investigated the effect of ERW on H₂O₂-induced U937 damage by evaluating the modulation of redox cellular state. Western blotting and spectrophotometrical analysis showed that ERW inhibited oxidative stress by restoring the antioxidant capacity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Consequently, ERW restores the ability of the glutathione reductase to supply the cell of an important endogenous antioxidant, such as GSH, reversing the inhibitory effect of H₂O₂ on redox balance of U937 cells. Therefore, this means a reduction of cytotoxicity induced by peroxynitrite via a downregulation of the NF-κB/iNOS pathway and could be used as an antioxidant for preventive and therapeutic application.

Although the protective effect of hydrogen on acute pancreatitis (AP) has been confirmed, its molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this article, we aimed to investigate the changes in pancreatic cell protein expression associated with the protective effect of H2 against AP and attempted to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying this process. A proteomic analysis identified 73 differentially expressed proteins and generated the protein-protein interaction networks of these proteins. The results triggered our interest in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hsc70). The subsequent in vitro experiments showed that H2 treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK; the activation of NF-κB and the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β, while simultaneously preventing the translocation of phospho-ERK, phospho-JNK, and phospho-p38 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Furthermore, Hsc70 expression was upregulated by H2 administration. The animal experiment results were consistent with those of the in vitro experiments. in conclusion, H2 treatment can ameliorate the inflammatory response and reduce the expression of inflammatory mediators during the early phase of AP by inhibiting the MAPK pathways and increasing Hsc70 expression.

Thus, hydrogen-rich water may prove to be an effective anti-aging drink. This study examined the effects of H2on endothelial senescence and clarified the mechanisms involved. Methods and results: Hydrogen-rich medium was produced by a high-purity hydrogen gas generator. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) for various time periods in normal or hydrogen-rich medium. The baseline H2concentration in hydrogen-rich medium was 0.55±0.07 mmol/L. This concentration gradually decreased, and H2was almost undetectable in medium after 12 h. At 24 h after TCDD exposure, HUVECs treated with TCDD exhibited increased 8OHdG and acetyl-p53 expression, decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))/NADH ratio, impaired Sirt1 activity, and enhanced senescence-associated β-galactosidase. However, HUVECs incubated in hydrogen-rich medium did not exhibit these TCDD-induced changes accompanying Nrf2 activation, which was observed even after H2was undetectable in the medium. Chrysin, an inhibitor of Nrf2, abolished the protective effects of H2on HUVECs. Conclusions: H2has long-lasting antioxidant and anti-aging effects on vascular endothelial cells through the Nrf2 pathway, even after transient exposure to H2. Hydrogen-rich water may thus be a functional drink that increases longevity. (Circ J 2016; 80: 2037-2046).

Ovarian reserve function plays an important role in female fertility. Recent studies have reported that hydrogen can protect male fertility. Therefore, we explored the potential protective effect of hydrogen-rich water on ovarian reserve function through a mouse immune POF model. Methods: To set up immune POF model, fifty female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: Control (mice consumed normal water, n = 10), hydrogen (mice consumed hydrogen-rich water, n = 10), model (mice were immunized with zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 [ZP3] and consumed normal water, n = 15), and model-hydrogen (mice were immunized with ZP3 and consumed hydrogen-rich water, n = 15) groups. After 5 weeks, mice were sacrificed. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, granulosa cell (GC) apoptotic index (AI), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) expression were examined. Analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software. Results: Immune POF model, model group exhibited markedly reduced serum AMH levels compared with those of the control group (5.41 ± 0.91 ng/ml vs. 16.23 ± 1.97 ng/ml, P = 0.033) and the hydrogen group (19.65 ± 7.82 ng/ml, P = 0.006). The model-hydrogen group displayed significantly higher AMH concentrations compared with that of the model group (15.03 ± 2.75 ng/ml vs. 5.41 ± 0.91 ng/ml, P = 0.021). The GC AI was significantly higher in the model group (21.30 ± 1.74%) than those in the control (7.06 ± 0.27%), hydrogen (5.17 ± 0.41%), and model-hydrogen groups (11.24 ± 0.58%) (all P < 0.001). The GC AI was significantly higher in the model-hydrogen group compared with that of the hydrogen group (11.24 ± 0.58% vs. 5.17 ± 0.41%, P = 0.021). Compared with those of the model group, ovarian tissue Bcl-2 levels increased (2.18 ± 0.30 vs. 3.01 ± 0.33, P = 0.045) and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio decreased in the model-hydrogen group. Conclusions: Hydrogen-rich water may improve serum AMH levels and reduce ovarian GC apoptosis in a mouse immune POF model induced by ZP3.

Hyperoxia treatment may be beneficial to critically ill patients. However, the clinical use of hyperoxia is hindered as it may exacerbate organ injury by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hydrogen gas (H2) exerts a therapeutic antioxidative effect by selectively reducing ROS. Combination therapy of H2 and hyperoxia has previously been shown to significantly improve survival rate and organ damage extent in mice with polymicrobial sepsis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia could improve survival rate and organ damage in a zymosan (ZY)-induced generalized inflammation model. The results showed that the inhalation of H2 (2%) or hyperoxia (98%) alone improved the 14-day survival rate of ZY-challenged mice from 20 to 70 or 60%, respectively. However, combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia could increase the 14-day survival rate of ZY-challenged mice to 100%. Furthermore, ZY-challenged mice showed significant multiple organ damage characterized by increased serum levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, as well as lung, liver and kidney histopathological scores at 24 h after ZY injection. These symptoms where attenuated by H2 or hyperoxia alone; however, combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia had a more marked beneficial effect against lung, liver and kidney damage in ZY-challenged mice. In addition, the beneficial effects of this combination therapy on ZY-induced organ damage were associated with decreased serum levels of the oxidative product 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α, increased activity of superoxide dismutase and reduced levels of the proinflammatory cytokines high-mobility group box 1 and tumor necrosis factor-α. In conclusion, combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia provides enhanced therapeutic efficacy against multiple organ damage in a ZY-induced generalized inflammation model, suggesting the potential applicability of H2 and hyperoxia in the therapy of conditions associated with inflammation-related MODS.

Novel therapeutic interventions during the perinatal period are required to prevent inflammation, but its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. Activated microglia are known to play a central role in brain injury by producing a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and releasing oxidative products. The study is aimed to investigate the preventative potential of molecular hydrogen (H2), which is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent without mutagenicity. Pregnant ICR mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally on embryonic day 17 to create a model of perinatal brain injury caused by prenatal inflammation. In this model, the effect of maternal administration of hydrogen water (HW) on pups was also evaluated. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative damage and activation of microglia were determined in the fetal brains. H2 reduced the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative damage and microglial activation in the fetal brains. Next, we investigated how H2 contributes to neuroprotection, focusing on microglia, using primary cultured microglia and neurons. H2 prevented LPS- or cytokine-induced generation of reactive oxidative species by microglia and reduced LPS-induced microglial neurotoxicity. Finally, we identified several molecules influenced by H2, involved in the process of activating microglia.

Subsequently, numerous studies have indicated the potential applications of H2 in therapeutic and preventive medicine. Moreover, H2 regulates various signal transduction pathways and the expression of many genes. However, the primary targets of H2 in the signal transduction pathways are unknown. Here, we attempted to determine how H2 regulates gene expression. In a pure chemical system, H2 gas (approximately 1%, v/v) suppressed the autoxidation of linoleic acid that proceeds by a free radical chain reaction, and pure 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC), one of the major phospholipids, was autoxidized in the presence or absence of H2. H2 modified the chemical production of the autoxidized phospholipid species in the cell-free system. Exposure of cultured cells to the H2-dependently autoxidized phospholipid species reduced Ca(2+) signal transduction and mediated the expression of various genes as revealed by comprehensive microarray analysis. In the cultured cells, H2 suppressed free radical chain reaction-dependent peroxidation and recovered the increased cellular Ca(2+), resulting in the regulation of Ca(2+)-dependent gene expression.

However, the formation of gas cavities after implantation of magnesium alloys has been widely reported in the literature. The composition of the gas and the concentration of its components in these cavities are not known as only a few studies using non-specific techniques were done about 60 years ago. Currently many researchers assume that these cavities contain primarily hydrogen because it is a product of magnesium corrosion in aqueous media. In order to clearly answer this question we implanted rare earth-containing magnesium alloy disks in mice and determined the concentration of hydrogen gas for up to 10 days using an amperometric hydrogen sensor and mass spectrometric measurements. We were able to directly monitor the hydrogen concentration over a period of 10 days and show that the gas cavities contained only a low concentration of hydrogen gas, even shortly after formation of the cavities. This means that hydrogen must be exchanged very quickly after implantation. To confirm these results hydrogen gas was directly injected subcutaneously. Most of the hydrogen gas was found to exchange within 1h after injection. Overall, our results disprove the common misbelief that these cavities mainly contain hydrogen and show how quickly this gas is exchanged with the surrounding tissue.

However, little is known about effects of H2 on exercise-induced oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of weekly hydrogen bathing on exercise-induced oxidative stress and delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Nine healthy and active young men participated in this study, and each subject performed hydrogen bathing trial and placebo bathing trial in a crossover design. The subjects performed downhill running (8 % decline) at 75 % peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) for 30 min, and each subjects conducted hydrogen or placebo bathing for 20 min, respectively, 1-6 days after downhill running. Before and after exercise, we measured visual analogue scale (VAS) and collected blood samples (Pre- and 5 min, 60 min after the end of bathing, 1day, 2days, 3days, 7days after downhill running). Blood sample analyses include creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin (Mb), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs), biological antioxidant potential (BAP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-17a (IL-17a) and lactate concentrations. Weekly hydrogen bathing had no effects of exercise-induced oxidative stress and muscle damage. On the other hand, hydrogen bathing significantly reduced DOMS (VAS) 1 and 2days after downhill running (p=0.033). These findings suggest that hydrogen bath after downhill exercise can be effective for reduction of DOMS.",Positive,Human,Muscle,Excercise,Soreness,Water (Mg-Chemico),Alkaline,Bath,,,Japan

Electrolyzed-reduced water is generated near cathode by electrolysis of water and shown to have strong anti-oxidant and lifespan-extending activities in C. elegans. Here, we examined the effect of electrolyzed-reduced water on amyloid beta toxicity and investigated underlying cellular mechanism involved. Worms grown in media prepared with electrolyzedreduced water showed delayed amyloid beta-induced paralysis and age-related decline in motility. DAF-16, a FOXO transcription factor modulating insulin/IGF-1-like signal, is required for the protection against amyloid beta toxicity. These findings indicate that electrolyzed-reduced water can prevent amyloid beta toxicity via DAF-16 and suggest that electrolyzedreduced water could be utilized for the development of therapeutic intervention to Alzheimer’s disease.",Positive,Nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans),Brain,Alzheimer's Disease (AD),Amyloid Beta Toxicity,Water (Electrolysis),Alkaline,Immersion,,,South Korea

First, the PQ optimal concentration was determined in RAW264.7 macrophage by treating serum-starved cells with PQ at 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mM. We evaluated at 1, 2 and 8 h (1) cell viability (by means of trypan blue exclusion method), (2) intracellular ROS levels (with a fluorescent DCFH-DA probe), and (3) TNF-α level in the culture media (determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA). Subsequently, mouse RAW267.4 macrophages were treated with PQ in combination with SAHA and/or H2 for 8 h. PQ exerted a significant stimulatory but nontoxic effect on RAW267.4 macrophages at 0.1 mM. This PQ concentration was used in the subsequent experiments. H2 and H2 combined with SAHA evoked a greater reduction in PQ-induced ROS production than SAHA alone, especially at 2 and 8 h. At 1 and 2 h, treatments involving H2 caused a greater decrease in PQ-induced production of TNF-α than the corresponding treatments without H2. However, at 8 h, treatment with SAHA evoked more pronounced effects on TNF-α than treatment without SAHA. H2 decreases PQ-induced ROS production and attenuates early PQ-induced TNF-α production whereas SAHA reduces the late phase of the PQ-induced TNF-α production in macrophages. The effects are enhanced by the combination of H2 and SAHA. ",Positive,Cell Culture,Whole Body,Environmental Pollution,Pesticide Toxicity (Paraquat),Gas,N/A,Ventilation,,,China

In this study, we investigated the effects of hydrogen-rich saline solution on the prevention of renal injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and on renal function recovery. Methods: A rat model of renal I/R injury was induced by 45 min occlusion of the left renal pedicle, followed by 108 h reperfusion. The right kidney was surgically removed. Then, 0.9% NaCl solution (1 ml/kg) or hydrogen-rich saline solution (HRSS; 1 ml/kg) was injected into the abdominal cavity at 4 h intervals. We assessed the influence of HRSS or control saline solution on the recovery of renal function after I/R injury. Kidney tissues were taken at different time points (24, 36, 48, 72, and 108 h after reperfusion) and frozen (-80°C). Kidney cell apoptosis was evaluated using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive staining. Additionally, the apoptotic factors (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, and caspase-8) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) were measured in the kidney tissues. Finally, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels were measured. Results: Histological analyses revealed a marked reduction of interstitial congestion, edema and hemorrhage in renal tissue after HRSS treatment compared to saline treatment. After I/R injury, BUN, Cr, Bcl-2, caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-8, IL-6, and TNF-α were all significantly increased, while Bax expression was decreased. HRSS remarkably reversed these changes. Moreover, BUN and Cr decreased more rapidly in the rats treated with HRSS compared to the rats treated with control saline solution. Conclusions: HRSS showed a protective effect in the prevention of renal injury and could promote renal function recovery after I/R injury in rats.

Global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) can induce a sudden activation of inflammatory cytokines and later influence the systemic immunoreactivity which may contribute to a worse outcome. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are involved in several pathological aspects of cerebral I/R. In addition, miRNA took part in the processes of cellular response to hypoxia. Since the expression of a specific set of miRNA called 'hypoxamirs' is upregulated by hypoxia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of HRS on I/R inducing cerebral damage, Tregs, and specific miRNA. Our results showed that rats undergone global cerebral I/R and treated with HRS have milder injury than I/R animals without HRS treatment. miR-210 expression in the hippocampus of the I/R group at 6, 24 and 96 h after reperfusion was significantly increased at each time point, while its expression in the group treated with HRS was significantly decreased. In addition, Tregs number in group I/R was decreased at each time points, while its number in the group treated with HRS was increased at 24 and 96 h after reperfusion. We focus on the relationship among Tregs, TGF-β1, TNF-α and NF-κB at 24 h, and we found that there is a high correlation among them. Therefore, our results indicated that the brain resuscitation mechanism in the HRS-treated rats may be related with the effect of upregulating the number of Treg cells.

However, molecular bases of H2 have not been fully elucidated. Cumulative evidence indicates that H2 acts as a gaseous signal modulator. We found that H2 suppresses activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling by promoting phosphorylation and degradation οf β-catenin. Either complete inhibition of GSK3 or mutations at CK1- and GSK3-phosphorylation sites of β-catenin abolished the suppressive effect of H2. H2 did not increase GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, indicating that H2 has no direct effect on GSK3 itself. Knock-down of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or Axin1, which form the β-catenin degradation complex, minimized the suppressive effect of H2 on β-catenin accumulation. Accordingly, the effect of H2 requires CK1/GSK3-phosphorylation sites of β-catenin, as well as the β-catenin degradation complex comprised of CK1, GSK3, APC, and Axin1. We additionally found that H2 reduces the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Oral intake of H2 water tended to ameliorate cartilage degradation in a surgery-induced rat osteoarthritis model through attenuating β-catenin accumulation. We first demonstrate that H2 suppresses abnormally activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which accounts for the protective roles of H2 in a fraction of diseases.

Mitochondria, which are targets of excessive reactive oxygen species and central mediators of apoptosis, have a pivotal role in hepatic injury during obstructive jaundice (OJ); however, the implications of HS in the hepatic mitochondria of BDL mice remain unknown. The present study investigated the hypothesis that HS could reduce OJ‑induced liver injury through the protection of mitochondrial structure and function, as well as inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three experimental groups: Sham operation group, BDL injury with normal saline (NS) treatment group, and BDL‑injury with HS treatment group. Mitochondrial damage and apoptotic parameters were determined 3 days post‑BDL injury and treatment. The results demonstrated that mitochondria isolated from the livers of NS-treated BDL mice exhibited increased mitochondrial swelling, cytochrome c release, and oxidative damage. In addition, liver samples from NS‑treated BDL mice exhibited significant increases in B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2)‑associated X protein expression, caspase activities, and hepatocyte apoptosis compared with livers from sham‑operated controls. Notably, treatment with HS reduced the levels of these markers and alleviated morphological defects in the mitochondria following injury. In addition, HS markedly increased the antioxidant potential of mitochondria, as evidenced by elevated adenosine triphosphate levels, mitochondrial respiratory function, and increased levels of active Bcl‑2.

It is reported that the risk of cardiovascular disease events increased if the fraction of reduced albumin (human mercaptalbumin (f(HMA))) was low and that the f(HMA) rose at the dialyzer outlet on EW-HD. Therefore, we studied whether the f(HMA) of hemodialysis patients was improved when they received long-term EW-HD treatment. Methods We produced hydrogen-dissolved hemodialysis fluid with EW-C81-HD and carried out EW-HD treatment for 12 patients. The serum albumin redox states of pre- and post-HD were measured in the summer of 2014 (EWHD2014) and in the winter of 2015 (EWHD2015) after 6 months by high-performance liquid chromatography using Shodex-Asahipak ES-502N 7C column.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) reportedly acts as an effective antioxidant. We investigated whether oral ingestion of hydrogen water (H2-water) has a beneficial effect on bladder function in a rat model of BOO. Materials and methods: H2-water was made by dissolving H2 gas in ordinary drinking water (OW) using a hydrogen water-producing apparatus. The BOO model was surgically induced in male rats. Rats with BOO were fed with H2-water or OW. On week 4 after surgery, cystometry was performed. Oxidative stress markers and bladder nerve growth factor (NGF) level were determined. Bladder tissues were processed for pharmacological studies and for histological analysis. Results: The micturition interval and micturition volume significantly decreased in the BOO rats given OW. These decreases were significantly suppressed by oral ingestion of H2-water. Increased post-void residual volume in the BOO rats was significantly reduced by H2-water. BOO led to a significant increase in bladder weight, oxidative stress markers and NGF level. H2-water significantly suppressed these increases without affecting bladder weight. There was no significant difference in histological findings between the BOO rats given H2-water and OW. Decreased responses of detrusor muscle strips from the obstructed bladder to KCl, carbachol and electrical field stimulation were reversed by ingestion of H2-water.

Hydrogen normalized LPS-induced abnormal enlargement of alveoli at P7 and P14. LPS increased staining for nitrotyrosine and 8-OHdG of the lungs, and hydrogen attenuated the staining. At P1, LPS treatment decreased expressions of genes for FGFR4, VEGFR2, and HO-1 in the lungs, and hydrogen increased expressions of these genes. In contrast, LPS treatment and hydrogen treatment had no essential effect on the expression of SOD1. Inflammatory marker proteins of TNFα and IL-6 were increased by LPS treatment, and hydrogen suppressed them.

Although the newborn piglet is an accepted large animal PA/HIE model, there is no consensus on PA-induction methodology to produce clinically relevant HIE. We aimed to create and to characterize a novel PA model faithfully reproducing all features of asphyxiation including severe hypercapnia resulting in HIE, and to test whether H2 is neuroprotective in this model. Piglets were anaesthetised, artificially ventilated, and intensively monitored (electroencephalography, core temperature, O2 saturation, arterial blood pressure and blood gases). Asphyxia (20 min) was induced by ventilation with a hypoxic-hypercapnic (6%O2 - 20%CO2) gas mixture. Asphyxia-induced changes in the cortical microcirculation were assessed with laser-speckle contrast imaging and analysis. Asphyxia was followed by reventilation with air or air containing hydrogen (2.1%H2, 4 hours). After 24 hours survival, the brains were harvested for neuropathology. Our PA model was characterized by the development of severe hypoxia (pO2 = 27 ± 4 mmHg), and combined acidosis (pH = 6.76 ± 0.04; pCO2 = 114 ± 11 mmHg; lactate = 12.12 ± 0.83 mmol/L), however, cortical ischemia did not develop during the stress. Severely depressed electroencephalography (EEG), and marked neuronal injury indicated the development of HIE. H2 was neuroprotective shown both by the enhanced recovery of EEG and by the significant preservation of neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and the thalamus. H2 appeared to reduce oxidative stress shown by attenuation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine immunostaining.

Hydrogen has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and potential therapeutic value. Solubilized hydrogen may be a portable and practical means of administering therapeutic hydrogen gas. We hypothesized that intraperitoneal administration of hydrogen-rich saline would ameliorate postoperative ileus. Methods: Ileus was induced via surgical manipulation in mice and rats. The peritoneal cavity was filled with 1.0 mL saline or hydrogen-rich saline (≥1.5-2.0 ppm) before closure of the abdominal incision. Intestinal transit was assessed 24 hours postoperatively. Inflammation was examined by quantitation of neutrophil extravasation and expression of proinflammatory markers. Nitric oxide production was assessed in cultured muscularis propria. Results: Surgical manipulation resulted in a marked delay in intestinal transit and was associated with upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and increased neutrophil extravasation. Bowel dysmotility, induced by surgical manipulation and inflammatory events, was significantly attenuated by intra-abdominal administration of hydrogen-rich saline. Nitric oxide production in the muscle layers of the bowel was inhibited by hydrogen treatment.

Amifostine (AM) is the only radioprotective drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in radiotherapy. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the combined radio-protective effect of hydrogen rich water (HRW) and AM. Materials and Methods: Male ICR mice were treated intragastrically with HRW or/and intraperitoneally with AM 30 minutes prior to 9.0 Gy whole body irradiation from a⁶⁰Co source (dose rate 0.96Gy/min). Then the survival rate for 30 days, the hematological parameters, the Clinical chemistry parameters and the bone marrow nucleated cells were examined. Results: We found that the mice treated with HRW and AM before irradiaion could increase the 30-day survival rate and improve the body weight better than the HRW or AM treatment alone group and irradiaion alone group. Hematological test and Clinical chemistry assays also showed the same results that HRW combined AM could beter improve the recovery of hemopoietic system and alleviate the detrimental effects of radiation.

Recently, the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in macrophages stimulated with LPS has been suggested to act as a trigger during the process of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that can be blocked by some mitochondria-targeted antioxidants. Known as a ROS scavenger, molecular hydrogen (H2) has been shown to possess therapeutic benefit on LPS-induced inflammatory damage in many animal experiments. Due to the unique molecular structure, H2 can easily target the mitochondria, suggesting that H2 is a potential antagonist of mtROS-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Here we have showed that, in mouse macrophages, H2 exhibited substantial inhibitory activity against LPS-initiated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by scavenging mtROS. Moreover, the elimination of mtROS by H2 resultantly inhibited mtROS-mediated NLRP3 deubiquitination, a non-transcriptional priming signal of NLRP3 in response to the stimulation of LPS. Additionally, the removal of mtROS by H2 reduced the generation of oxidized mitochondrial DNA and consequently decreased its binding to NLRP3, thereby inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our findings have, for the first time, revealed the novel mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of molecular hydrogen on LPS-caused NLRP3 inflammasome activation, highlighting the promising application of this new antioxidant in the treatment of LPS-associated inflammatory pathological damage.

Molecular hydrogen has proven useful and convenient as a novel antioxidant and modifier of gene expression in many conditions where oxidative stress and changes in gene expression result in cellular damage. Our intracellular biomarker studies have shown that a hydrogenized water drink formula containing 2.6 ppm dissolved hydrogen was able to penetrate cellular membranes and function as an antioxidant in human liver cells (HePG2) utilizing the Cellular Antioxidant Assay (CAA). This assay uses the protection of a florescent probe as a marker for cellular damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as peroxyl radical, and compares this to the known antioxidant standard, Quercetin. Using this system oxidative damage was reduced in a dose-dependent manner. One ml of hydrogenized water was found to possess antioxidant capacity equivalent to 0.05 µmole of quercetin. When examined in a human colon cell line (Caco-2 cells), hydrogenized water demonstrated a dose-and time-dependent permeability inhibition of an intracellular fluorescent glucose derivative (2-NBDG), indicating decreased glucose uptake. In another study, the impact of hydrogenized water on Akt phosphorylation (Ser473), a biomarker for insulin signaling, was monitored in human skeletal muscle cells. The hydrogenized water treatment markedly elevated the level of phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-aging effects of hydrogenized water were examined utilizing SIRT1 expression as a biomarker of aging in human umbilical cells (HUVECs). Hydrogenized water increased dose-dependent SIRT1 gene expression. Hydrogenized water also increased telomerase activity (an anti-aging biomarker in HUVEC cells) up to 148% when cells were treated with media containing 25% hydrogenized water formula. Increased telomerase activity caused by hydrogenized water may be able to protect telomeres from degradation, suggesting the possible use of hydrogenized water in therapeutic interventions of age-related diseases. These studies show that commercial hydrogenized water improved the levels or activities of a few intracellular biomarkers specific for antioxidant activity, glucose uptake, insulin signaling and SIRT 1 and telomerase activities. Industrial Relevance: The molecular hydrogen used in this study indicates that certain commercial sources of hydrogenized water can provide similar antioxidant and gene expression modifications seen in other sources of molecular hydrogen.

In our investigation, 144 Ross × Ross broiler chicks were randomly allotted to three different treatment groups with four replicates (treatment × replicate × bird = 3 × 4 × 12). All chicks were given one of the following types of water for five weeks: tap water (CON), hydrogenated water (HNW), and oxygenated water (ONW). ONW supplementation increased the final body weight and weight gain and also improved both feed intake and feed conversion of broiler chickens as compared to those of CON broiler chickens (P < 0.05). The abdominal fat and its ratio to the final body weight showed that fat accumulation in the broiler chicken abdomen was reduced when broiler chickens drank only ONW for five weeks (P < 0.05). ONW supplementation improved blood parameters, including triacylglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol.

Additionally, proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and oxidative stress play important roles in wound healing. The aim of this study was to determine whether hydrogen-rich water intake induces the activation of the Nrf2/antioxidant defense pathway in rat palatal tissue, thereby reducing systemic oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine levels and promoting healing-associated genes. A circular excisional wound was created in the oral palatal region, and the wound healing process was observed. The rats were divided into two experimental groups in which either hydrogen-rich water or distilled water was consumed. In the drinking hydrogen-rich water, the palatal wound healing process was accelerated compared to that in the control group. As molecular hydrogen upregulated the Nrf2 pathway, systemic oxidative stresses were decreased by the activation of antioxidant activity. Furthermore, hydrogen-rich water intake reduced proinflammatory cytokine levels and promoted the expression of healing-associated factors in rat palatal tissue. In conclusion, hydrogen-rich water intake exhibited multiple beneficial effects through activation of the Nrf2/antioxidant defense pathway.

No specific hydration marker is universally accepted as an ideal rehydration parameter following strenuous exercise. Currently, changes in body mass are used as a parameter during post-exercise hydration. Additional parameters are needed to fully appreciate and better understand rehydration following strenuous exercise. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm trial assessed the effect of high-pH water on four biomarkers after exercise-induced dehydration. Methods: One hundred healthy adults (50 M/50 F, 31 ± 6 years of age) were enrolled at a single clinical research center in Camden, NJ and completed this study with no adverse events. All individuals exercised in a warm environment (30 °C, 70% relative humidity) until their weight was reduced by a normally accepted level of 2.0 ± 0.2% due to perspiration, reflecting the effects of exercise in producing mild dehydration. Participants were randomized to rehydrate with an electrolyzed, high-pH (alkaline) water or standard water of equal volume (2% body weight) and assessed for an additional 2-h recovery period following exercise in order to assess any potential variations in measured parameters. The following biomarkers were assessed at baseline and during their recovery period: blood viscosity at high and low shear rates, plasma osmolality, bioimpedance, and body mass, as well as monitoring vital signs. Furthermore, a mixed model analysis was performed for additional validation. Results: After exercise-induced dehydration, consumption of the electrolyzed, high-pH water reduced high-shear viscosity by an average of 6.30% compared to 3.36% with standard purified water (p = 0.03). Other measured biomarkers (plasma osmolality, bioimpedance, and body mass change) revealed no significant difference between the two types of water for rehydration. However, a mixed model analysis validated the effect of high-pH water on high-shear viscosity when compared to standard purified water (p = 0.0213) after controlling for covariates such as age and baseline values. Conclusions: A significant difference in whole blood viscosity was detected in this study when assessing a high-pH, electrolyte water versus an acceptable standard purified water during the recovery phase following strenuous exercise-induced dehydration.

In the hydrogen water group, 5-mL/kg hydrogen water was orally administered two days after birth daily for 10 days in addition to conventional treatment. After 10 days, efficacy indicators were examined in the HIE groups. The NSE, IL-6, and TNF-α levels were compared among all three groups. The efficacy indicators were significantly lower in the hydrogen water group compared with the conventional group. Before treatment, the serum NSE, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in the HIE groups were higher than those in the control group. After treatment, these levels in the hydrogen water group were lower than those in the conventional group. Hydrogen water lowers serum NSE, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in HIE newborns, thereby exerting a protective effect.

Hydrogen gas (H2) can ameliorate multiple organ damage in septic animals. Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1 (mDia1) are important to regulate tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ), both of which determine the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This study was aimed to investigate whether H2 could modulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated dysfunction of the intestinal barrier and whether RhoA-mDia1 signaling is involved. Caco-2 cells were exposed to different concentrations of LPS (1 μg/mL-1 mg/mL). The permeability of the intestinal barrier was evaluated by transepithelial resistance (TER) and fluorescein-isothiocyanate-dextran flux. Expression and distribution of occludin and E-cadherin were analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. RhoA activity was measured by G-Lisa assay, and mDia1 expression was assessed by Western blot. LPS (100 μg/mL) decreased TER and increased fluorescein-isothiocyanate-dextran flux, which were alleviated by H2-rich medium. Also, H2 down-regulated LPS-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, H2 improved the down-regulated expression and redistribution of occludin and E-cadherin caused by LPS. Additionally, H2 alleviated LPS-caused RhoA activation, and the beneficial effects of H2 on barrier were counteracted by RhoA agonist CN03. Rho inhibitor C3 exoenzyme mitigated LPS-induced barrier breakdown. Furthermore, H2-rich medium increased mDia1 expression, and mDia1 knockdown abolished protections of H2 on barrier permeability. mDia1 knockdown eliminated H2-induced benefits for occludin and E-cadherin. These findings suggest that H2 improves LPS-induced hyperpermeability of the intestinal barrier and disruptions of TJ and AJ by moderating RhoA-mDia1 signaling.

Moreover, its toxicity and side effects are rarely reported. We sought to clarify the protective effect of HRS against the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) in C57BL/6 J model. Main methods: The OIR in the HRS treated mice and the untreated controls were systematically compared. The retinas of both groups were analyzed using high-molecular-weight FITC-dextran staining of flat-mount preparations, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of cross-sections. The distribution and expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were also evaluated by the immunohistochemical measurements between postnatal days 17 (P17) and P21. Key finding: The leakage and non-perfusion areas of retinal blood vessels were not alleviated in the HRS treatment group. Moreover, the number of preretinal vascular endothelial cell in the HRS treatment group was similar to that in the untreated group after exposure to hyperoxia (P>0.05). The degree of OIR was positively correlated with the expression level of VEGF. Intriguingly, the preretinal vascular endothelial cell count in the retinas of pups reared in room air with HRS treatment was 15.21±2.98. The preretinal vascular endothelial cell count of the HRS treated mice was significantly higher than that of the untreated group reared in room air. Significance: In summary, HRS therapy (at the dose of 10ml/day, applied between P12 and P17) did not inhibit retinal neovascularization in OIR; On the contrary, it would induce the retinal neovascularization during the development of normal retinas.",Neutral,Mouse,Eye,Retinal Injury,Hyperoxia,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of hydrogen on proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) stimulated by angiotensin II (Ang II) in vitro, and on vascular hypertrophy induced by abdominal aortic coarctation (AAC) in vivo. Hydrogen-rich medium (0.6~0.9 ppm) was added 30 min before 10⁻⁷ M Ang II administration, then the proliferation and migration index were determined 24 h after Ang II stimulation. Hydrogen gas (99.999%) was given by intraperitoneal injection at the dose of 1 ml/100 g/day consecutively for one week before AAC and lasted for 6 weeks in vivo. Hydrogen inhibited proliferation and migration of VSMCs with Ang II stimulation in vitro, and improved the vascular hypertrophy induced by AAC in vivo. Treatment with hydrogen reduced Ang II- or AAC-induced oxidative stress, which was reflected by diminishing the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Ang II-stimulated VSMCs, inhibiting the levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) in vascular and serum malondialdehyde (MDA). Hydrogen treatment also blocked Ang II-induced phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, c-Jun NH₂-terminal kinase (JNK) and the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) in vitro. Taken together, our studies indicate that hydrogen prevents AAC-induced vascular hypertrophy in vivo, and inhibits Ang II-induced proliferation and migration of VSMCs in vitro possibly by targeting ROS-dependent ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK and ERM signaling. It provides the molecular basis of hydrogen on inhibiting the abnormal proliferation and migration of VSMCs and improving vascular remodeling diseases.

The goal of the present study is to determine the pharmacodynamics of H2 in a model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Methods: Mice (C57BL/6J; 8–10 weeks of age) were randomly assigned to four groups: Control group (n = 10), ISO group (n = 12), ISO plus H2 group (n = 12), and H2 group (n = 12). Mice received H2 (1 ml/100g/day, intraperitoneal injection) for 7 days before ISO (0.5 mg/100g/day, subcutaneous injection) infusion, and then received ISO with or without H2 for another 7 days. Then, cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography. Cardiac hypertrophy was reflected by heart weight/body weight, gross morphology of hearts, and heart sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and relative atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) mRNA levels. Cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS), 3-nitrotyrosine and p67 (phox) levels were analyzed by dihydroethidium staining, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. For in vitro study, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were pretreated with H2-rich medium for 30 min, and then treated with ISO (10 μM) for the indicated time. The medium and ISO were re-changed every 24 h. Cardiomyocyte surface areas, relative ANP and BNP mRNA levels, the expression of 3-nitrotyrosine, and the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were examined. Moreover, the expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), p-ERK1/2, p38, p-p38, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p-JNK were measured by Western blotting both in vivo and in vitro. Results: Intraperitoneal injection of H2 prevented cardiac hypertrophy and improved cardiac function in ISO-infused mice. H2-rich medium blocked ISO-mediated cardiomyocytes hypertrophy in vitro. H2 blocked the excessive expression of NADPH oxidase and the accumulation of ROS, attenuated the decrease of MMP, and inhibited ROS-sensitive ERK1/2, p38, and JNK signaling pathways.

Patients or animal models of depression show significant increase of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and oxidative stress biomarkers in the periphery or central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies show that hydrogen selectively reduces cytotoxic oxygen radicals, and hydrogen-rich saline potentially suppresses the production of several proinflammatory mediators. Since current depression medications are accompanied by a wide spectrum of side effects, novel preventative or therapeutic measures with fewer side effects might have a promising future. We investigated the effects of drinking hydrogen-rich water on the depressive-like behavior in mice and its underlying mechanisms. Our study show that hydrogen-rich water treatment prevents chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced depressive-like behavior. CUMS induced elevation in IL-1β protein levels in the hippocampus, and the cortex was significantly attenuated after 4 weeks of feeding the mice hydrogen-rich water. Over-expression of caspase-1 (the IL-1β converting enzyme) and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was successfully suppressed by hydrogen-rich water treatment. Our data suggest that the beneficial effects of hydrogen-rich water on depressive-like behavior may be mediated by suppression of the inflammasome activation resulting in attenuated protein IL-1β and ROS production.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of H2 gas on AP both in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro assessment, AR42J cells were treated with cerulein and then incubated in H2-rich or normal medium for 24 h, and for the in vivo experiment, AP was induced through a retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatobiliary duct (0.1 mL/100 g body weight). Wistar rats were treated with inhaled air or 2% H2 gas and sacrificed 12 h following the induction of pancreatitis. Specimens were collected and processed to measure the amylase and lipase activity levels; the myeloperoxidase activity and production levels; the cytokine mRNA expression levels; the 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, malondialdehyde, and glutathione levels; and the cell survival rate. Histological examinations and immunohistochemical analyses were then conducted. The results revealed significant reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of H2 gas were associated with reductions in AR42J cell and pancreatic tissue damage. In conclusion, our results suggest that H2 gas is capable of ameliorating damage to the pancreas and AR42J cells and that H2 exerts protective effects both in vitro and in vivo on subjects with AP.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) plays an essential role in endothelial cellular defenses against inflammation by activating nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). We found that molecular hydrogen (H2) exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. Here, we hypothesized that H2 attenuates endothelial injury and inflammation via an Nrf2-mediated HO-1 pathway during sepsis. First, we detected the effects of H2 on cell viability and cell apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated by LPS. Then, we measured cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory factors in HUVECs stimulated by LPS and in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis mouse model. Next, the role of Nrf2/HO-1 was investigated in activated HUVECs, as well as in wild-type and Nrf(-/-) mice with sepsis. We found that both 0.3 mmol/L and 0.6 mmol/L (i.e., saturated) H2-rich media improved cell viability and cell apoptosis in LPS-activated HUVECs and that 0.6mmol/L (i.e., saturated) H2-rich medium exerted an optimal effect. H2 could suppress the release of cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). Furthermore, H2 could elevate anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels in LPS-stimulated HUVECs and in lung tissue from CLP mice. H2 enhanced HO-1 expression and activity in vitro and in vivo. HO-1 inhibition reversed the regulatory effects of H2 on cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory factors. H2 regulated endothelial injury and the inflammatory response via Nrf2-mediated HO-1 levels.

Peripheral nerve injury contributes to rapid progress of inflammatory response and simultaneously generates neuropathic pain. Hydrogen (H2) has anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-oxidative stress effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that H2 treatment could alleviate allodynic and hyperalgesic behaviors and the release of inflammatory factors in rats with neuropathic pain. Peripheral neuropathic pain was established by chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerve in rats. H2 was given twice through intraperitoneal injection at a daily dose of 10 mL/kg during days 1-7 after the operation. Hyperalgesia and allodynia were tested, pro-inflammatory factors of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal cord were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during days 1-14 after the operation, and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression and activities were measured at day 14 after sciatic nerve injury in rats. After Sn (IV) protoporphyrin IX dihydrochloride (SnPP)-IX, hemin, and carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CORM)-2 had been given for chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats, the above indicators were assessed. We found that H2 clearly inhibited hyperalgesia and allodynia in neuropathic pain and also attenuated the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and high-mobility group box (HMGB) 1.

To date, the related mechanism and effective therapy have not been rigorously explored. The present study aimed to explore the role of p53-mediated autophagy in the protective effect of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) on AKI after orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT). Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into four groups: sham, OLT, OLT with HRS (6 ml/kg) pretreatment (HS), OLT with HRS and chloroquine pretreatment (60 mg/kg) group (CQ). All the samples were collected 6 hours after reperfusion. The renal function and oxidative stress level were measured by biochemical and histopathologic examinations. The formation of autophagosome was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The apoptotic rate was determined by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling analysis. The expression of caspase-3, cytochrome c, p53, damage-regulated autophagy modulator, Becline-1, microtubule-associated protein light 3-II, p62, lysosome-associated membrane protein-2, and the phosphorylation of p53 were assayed by western blot assay. Results: Compared with the OLT group, HRS dramatically attenuated the histopathologic damage, restored the renal function, and decreased the oxidative stress level. Simultaneously, HRS significantly ameliorated apoptosis by decreasing the apoptotic rate and inhibiting the expression of caspase-3 and cytochrome c in rats subjected to OLT. The expression of Becline-1 and microtubule-associated protein light 3-II were upregulated with the inhibition of p62 and lysosome-associated membrane protein-2. The inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine counteracted the renoprotective effects of HRS. Conclusions: HRS is able to protect against AKI after liver transplantation partly by reducing apoptosis, which is possibly involved in the modulation of p53-mediated autophagy.",Positive,Rat,Kidney,Surgery/Transplantation,Transplantation/Graft Injury,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

However, limited studies focus on how to protect intestine against hemorrhagic shock. Ringer's solution, pentoxifylline and hypertonic saline are widely used to resuscitate in haemorrhagic shock and sepsis tissue injury. Evidence showed that hydrogen inhibited inflammation and reduced oxidative damage. Here we tested the hypothesis whether hydrogen rich Ringer's, pentoxifyline and hypertonic saline solutions increase the benefit in protecting small intestine from injury in uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock rat model. We tested the anti-inflammation effect of H-Ringer's, HHES and HHSH administration. We found hydrogen-rich solutions treatment groups showed the decreased MDA, MPO, IL-6 and TNF-α levels, and increased SOD, IL-10 comparing with those of non-hydrogen solutions administration groups. Our histological results showed that these three solutions with saturation hydrogen alleviatived the intestinal injury including the intact intestinal villi and less neutrephil infiltration. Our results indicate that these three hydrogen-rich solutions can protect intestinal injure after uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock. The protective effect might be through inhibiting proinflammatory factors, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines and reducing inflammatory cells infiltration.

We have previously demonstrated that electrolytically generated acid functional water (FW) induces the expression of hBD2 in the human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line Ca9-22. However, the induction was not dependent on NF-κB activity; in fact, FW inhibited NF-κB activity. Therefore, we hypothesized that FW might reduce spontaneous interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion by Ca9-22 cells, which is heavily dependent on NF-κB activity. This study aimed at demonstrating the inhibitory effect of FW on NF-κB activity. Methods: Ca9-22 cells were incubated with FW, and spontaneous IL-8 secretion was observed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Luciferase assay was performed using the 5'-untranslated region of the IL-8 gene. The steps of NF-κB activation blocked by FW were evaluated by localization of the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 by immunofluorescence staining. Western blotting was further performed to confirm the changes in NF-κB subunit localization. Results: The Ca9-22 cells spontaneously secreted IL-8, which was rapidly and drastically inhibited by FW treatment. The luciferase assay demonstrated the inhibitory action of FW, which was diminished by deletion of the NF-κB binding site from this construct. FW treatment altered the distribution of both the p65 and p50 subunits. P65, which was localized in the nucleus during the resting state, moved to the cytoplasm after FW treatment, whereas, p50, localized in the cytoplasm during the resting state, moved to the nucleus subsequent to FW treatment.

Methods: Two trophoblast cell lines, JAR and JEG-3, were exposed to different concentrations of vitamin C (0, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000 μmol/L), vitamin E (0, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000 μmol/L), and molecular hydrogen (0, 25, 50, 100, 500 μmol/L) for 48 h. The cell viability was detected using the MTS assay. The secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were assessed and the expression of TNF-α mRNA was observed by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Cell viability was significantly suppressed by 500 μmol/L vitamins C and E (P < 0.05), but not by 500 μmol/L molecular hydrogen (P > 0.05). The expression of TNF-α was increased by 100 μmol/L vitamin C and 50 μmol/L vitamins E, separately or combined (P < 0.05), but not by molecular hydrogen (0-500 μmol/L), as validated by real-time RT-PCR. But the secretion of hCG was both inhibited by 50-500 μmol/L molecular hydrogen and high levels of vitamin C and E, separately or combined. Conclusion: High levels of antioxidant vitamins C and E may have significant detrimental effects on placental function, as reflected by decreased cell viability and secretion of hCG; and placental immunity, as reflected by increased production of TNF-a. Meanwhile hydrogen showed no such effects on cell proliferation and TNF-α expression, but it could affect the level of hCG, indicating hydrogen as a potential candidate of antioxidant in the management of preeclampsia (PE) should be further studied.

The zone of stasis is more likely to develop more severe during wound progression in the presence of hypoperfusion. Hydrogen has been reported to alleviate injury triggered by ischaemia/reperfusion and burns in various organs by selectively quenching oxygen free radicals. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective effects of hydrogen against early burn-wound progression. Methods: Deep-burn models were established through contact with a boiled, rectangular, brass comb for 20 s. Fifty-six Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham, burn plus saline, and burn plus hydrogen-rich saline (HS) groups with sacrifice and analysis at various time windows (6 h, 24 h, 48 h) post burn. Indexes of oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy were measured in each group. The zone of stasis was evaluated using immunofluorescence staining, ELISA, and Western blot to explore the underlying effects and mechanisms post burn. Results: The burn-induced increase in malondialdehyde was markedly reduced with HS, while the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes were significantly increased. Moreover, HS treatment attenuated increases in apoptosis and autophagy postburn in wounds, according to the TUNEL staining results and the expression analysis of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, Beclin-1 and Atg-5 proteins. Additionally, HS lowered the level of myeloperoxidase and expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the zone of stasis while augmenting IL-10. The elevated levels of Akt phosphorylation and NF-κB p65 expression post burn were also downregulated by HS management. Conclusion: Hydrogen can attenuate early wound progression following deep burn injury. The beneficial effect of hydrogen was mediated by attenuating oxidative stress, which inhibited apoptosis and inflammation, and the Akt/NF-κB signalling pathway may be involved in regulating the release of inflammatory cytokines.",Positive,Rat,Skin,Wound Healing,Burn,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

To overcome this problem, donation after cardiac death (DCD) and ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) are being widely investigated. In this study, the effect of hydrogen gas, a known antioxidant, was investigated on a DCD lung model during EVLP. Ten pigs were randomized into either a control (n = 5) or a hydrogen group (n = 5). After fibrillation by electric shock, no further treatment was administered in order to induce warm ischaemic injury for 1 h. The lungs were then procured, followed by 4 h of EVLP. During EVLP, the lungs were ventilated with room air in the control group, and with 2% hydrogen gas in the hydrogen group. Oxygen capacity (OC), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and peak airway pressure (PAP) were measured every hour, and the expressions of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6 (IL-6), IL-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were evaluated in lung tissue after EVLP. Pathological evaluations were performed using lung injury severity (LIS) scores and the wet/dry ratio was also measured. The OC in the hydrogen group was higher than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.0862). PVR (P = 0.0111) and PAP (P = 0.0189) were statistically significantly lower in the hydrogen group. Compared with the control group, the hydrogen group had a statistically significantly lower expression of IL-1β (P = 0.0317), IL-6 (P = 0.0159), IL-8 (P = 0.0195) and TNF-α (P = 0.0159). The LIS scores (P = 0.0358) and wet/dry ratios (P = 0.040) were also significantly lower in the hydrogen group.

Parvalbumin and hippocalcin are two calcium buffering proteins, which are involved in neuronal differentiation, maturation and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether HRW could moderate parvalbumin and hippocalcin expression during ischemic brain injury and glutamate toxicity-induced neuronal cell death. Focal brain ischemia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Rats were treated with H2O or HRW (6 ml/kg per rat) before and after MCAO, and cerebral cortical tissues were collected 1, 7 and 14 days after MCAO. Based on our results, HRW treatment was able to reduce brain infarct volume and improve neurological function following ischemic brain injury. In addition, HRW prevented the ischemia-induced reduction of parvalbumin and hippocalcin levels in vivo and also reduced the glutamate toxicity-induced death of neurons, including the dose-dependent reduction of glutamate toxicity-associated proteins in vitro. Moreover, HRW attenuated the glutamate toxicity-induced elevate in intracellular Ca(2+) levels. All these results suggest that HRW could protect against ischemic brain injury and that the maintenance of parvalbumin and hippocalcin levels by HRW during ischemic brain injury might contribute to the neuroprotective effects against neuron damage.

Basic procedures: Intraperitoneally-applied deuterium gas was used as a metabolic tracer and deuterium enrichment was determined in the body water pool. Also, in vitro experiments were performed using bovine heart submitochondrial particles to evaluate superoxide formation in Complex I of the respiratory chain. Main findings: A significant oxidation of about 10% of the applied dose was found under physiological conditions in rats, proving its antioxidant properties. Hypoxia or endotoxin application did not exert any effect, whilst pure oxygen inhalation reduced deuterium oxidation. During in vitro experiments, a significant reduction of superoxide formation by Complex I of the respiratory chain was found under the influence of hydrogen. The possible molecular mechanisms of the beneficial effects of hydrogen are discussed, with an emphasis on the role of iron sulphur clusters in reactive oxygen species generation and on iron species-dihydrogen interaction.

Effective treatments, including pathogenesis-based biological agents against psoriasis, are currently under development. Although the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has been investigated, it remains to be fully elucidated; ROS-targeted therapeutic strategies are also lacking at present. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to assess whether H2, a ROS scavenger, has a therapeutic effect on psoriasis-associated inflammation by reducing hydroxyl radicals or peroxynitrite in the immunogenic psoriasis cascade. Three methods were used to administer H2: Drop infusion of saline containing 1 ppm H2 (H2-saline), inhalation of 3% H2 gas, and drinking of water containing a high concentration (5-7-ppm) of H2 (high-H2 water). Treatment efficacy was estimated using the disease activity score 28 (DAS28) system, based on C-reactive protein levels, and the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score, determined at baseline and following each H2 treatment. Furthermore, levels of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-17 were analyzed. The DAS28 and PASI score of the three patients decreased during H2 treatment, regardless of the administration method. The psoriatic skin lesions almost disappeared at the end of the treatment. IL-6 levels decreased during H2 treatment in Case 1 and 2. IL-17, whose concentration was high in Case 1, was reduced following H2 treatment, and TNFα also decreased in Case 1. In conclusion, H2 administration reduced inflammation associated with psoriasis in the three cases examined and it may therefore be considered as a treatment strategy for psoriasis-associated skin lesions and arthritis.

Stromal cell-derived factor-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expressions were evaluated by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Pulmonary arterial hypertension was significantly exacerbated in group M compared to group C, but was significantly improved in group H. Vascular density was significantly reduced in group M, but not in group H. Adventitial macrophages, antiproliferating cell nuclear antigen - and 8-OHdG-positive cells, and stromal cell-derived factor-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expressions were significantly increased in group M, but improved in group H. Expressions of phosphorylated STAT3 and NFAT were up-regulated in group M, but improved in group H. Conclusions: Molecular hydrogen ameliorates MCT-induced PAH in rats by suppressing macrophage accumulation, reducing oxidative stress and modulating the STAT3/NFAT axis.",Positive,Rat,Heart,Hypertension,Oxidative Stress,Water (Electrolysis),Alkaline,Ingestion,,,Japan

Hydrogen, a therapeutic gas, has potent cytoprotective, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant effects. This study examined the effects of inhaled hydrogen on ALI caused by HS/R. Rats were subjected to hemorrhagic shock by withdrawing blood to lower blood pressure followed by resuscitation with shed blood and saline to restore blood pressure. After HS/R, the rats were maintained in a control gas of similar composition to room air or exposed to 1.3% hydrogen. HS/R induced ALI, as demonstrated by significantly impaired gas exchange, congestion, edema, cellular infiltration, and hemorrhage in the lungs. Hydrogen inhalation mitigated lung injury after HS/R, as indicated by significantly improved gas exchange and reduced cellular infiltration and hemorrhage. Hydrogen inhalation did not affect hemodynamic status during HS/R. Exposure to 1.3% hydrogen significantly attenuated the upregulation of the messenger RNAs for several proinflammatory mediators induced by HS/R. Lipid peroxidation was reduced significantly in the presence of hydrogen, indicating antioxidant effects. Hydrogen, administered through inhalation, may exert potent therapeutic effects against ALI induced by HS/R and attenuate the activation of inflammatory cascades. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, we conducted a randomized controlled study, applying SAEW in the treatment of perforated appendicitis in children. Methods: Forty-four patients, aged 3-14 years, were randomly divided into two groups: Group S (n = 20), in which the peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 100 ml/kg saline and the wound was washed out with 200 ml saline; and Group E (n = 24), in which the peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 100 ml/kg SAEW and the wound was washed out with 200 ml SAEW. Results: No adverse effect of SAEW was observed in Group E. There was no difference in the bacterial evanescence ratio of ascitic fluid after lavage between Groups S and E (11.1 and 15.8%, respectively). A residual abscess developed in one patient from each group (5.0 and 4.2%, respectively). The incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) was significantly lower in Group E than in Group S (0 and 20%, respectively; P < 0.05). There was no difference in the duration of pyrexia, positive C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, or hospital stay between the groups. Conclusion: Peritoneal lavage and wound washing with SAEW have no adverse effects and are effective for preventing SSI.

Male Institute for Cancer Research mice were randomized into 6 groups: sham; sham + H2; severe sepsis; severe sepsis + H2; severe sepsis + zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX), a heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor; and severe sepsis + H2 + ZnPPIX. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to induce sepsis. Mice in the H2 groups received inhaled 2% H2 for 1 h at 1 h and 6 h after CLP or sham operation. Mice in the ZnPPIX groups received 40-mg/kg ZnPPIX by intraperitoneal injection 1 h before CLP. Tin protoporphyrin IX (TinPPIX), another HO-1 inhibitor, was also used in part for this study. Mice in the TinPPIX groups received 50-mg/kg TinPPIX through subcutaneous injection 6 h before CLP. The levels of biochemical markers, oxidative products, inflammatory mediator, the number of intestinal apoptotic cells, and the colony-forming unit numbers in the peritoneal lavage fluid were much higher in the severe sepsis group compared with the sham group. Intestinal injury in animals with severe sepsis was worse than that in animals in the sham group. H2 therapy in the animals with severe sepsis was associated with reduced intestinal injury, decreased numbers of colony-forming unit and apoptotic cells, reduced levels of biochemical markers, oxidative products, and high-mobility group box 1 protein. The protective effects of H2 were reversed by ZnPPIX and TinPPIX. Protein and messenger RNA expressions of HO-1 and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the intestine were increased in the severe sepsis group compared to the sham group, and H2 further increased their expressions in the severe septic mice.

Hydrogen gas (H2) is effective for treating sepsis. In this study, we hypothesized that the protective function of H2 in mice with septic lung injury occurred through the activation of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and its upstream regulator nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Male institute of cancer research mice were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with the presence or absence of H2. Beginning at 1 and 6 h after CLP or sham operation, respectively, 2% H2 was inhaled for 1 h. We intraperitoneally injected the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (40 mg/kg) 1 h before CLP. To assess the severity of septic lung injury, we observed the 7-d survival rate, wet/dry weight ratio of lung, lung histopathologic score, oxygenation index, and so forth. Serum and homogenates from the lung, liver, and kidney were acquired for measuring the levels of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) at 6, 12, and 24 h after CLP or sham operation. Furthermore, the protein and messenger RNA expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and HMGB1 was measured at 6, 12, and 24 h. Septic mice had a lower survival rate and more severe lung injury compared with the sham group. However, therapy with H2 increased the survival rate and alleviated the severity of lung injury, reduced the HMGB1 level, and increased the HO-1 and Nrf2 levels in septic mice. Moreover, the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX significantly eliminated the protective effect of H2 on septic lung injury. H2 plays a significant role in regulating the release of the inflammatory cytokine HMGB1 in septic mice, which is partially mediated through the activation of HO-1 as a downstream molecule of Nrf2.

Previous evidence suggests Aβ-induced neurotoxicity is linked to the stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The accumulation of Aβ-induced ROS leads to increased mitochondrial dysfunction and triggers apoptotic cell death. This suggests antioxidant therapies may be beneficial for preventing ROS-related diseases such as AD. Recently, hydrogen-rich water (HRW) has been proven effective in treating oxidative stress-induced disorders because of its ROS-scavenging abilities. However, the precise molecular mechanisms whereby HRW prevents neuronal death are still unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the putative pathways by which HRW protects against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. Our results indicated that HRW directly counteracts oxidative damage by neutralizing excessive ROS, leading to the alleviation of Aβ-induced cell death. In addition, HRW also stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in a sirtuin 1 (Sirt1)-dependent pathway, which upregulates forkhead box protein O3a (FoxO3a) downstream antioxidant response and diminishes Aβ-induced mitochondrial potential loss and oxidative stress. Taken together, our findings suggest that HRW may have potential therapeutic value to inhibit Aβ-induced neurotoxicity.

Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been reported to ameliorate ALI. However, reactive nitrogen species produced by NO can cause lung injury. Because hydrogen gas (H2) is reported to eliminate peroxynitrite, it is expected to reduce the adverse effects of NO. Moreover, we have found that H2 inhalation can attenuate lung injury. Therefore, we hypothesized that combination therapy with NO and H2 might afford more potent therapeutic strategies for ALI. In the present study, a mouse model of ALI was induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The animals were treated with inhaled NO (20 ppm), H2 (2%), or NO + H2, starting 5 min after LPS administration for 3 h. We found that LPS-challenged mice exhibited significant lung injury characterized by the deterioration of histopathology and histologic scores, wet-to-dry weight ratio, and oxygenation index (ratio of oxygen tension to inspired oxygen fraction [Pao2/Fio2]), as well as total protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which was attenuated by NO or H2 treatment alone. Combination therapy with NO and H2 had a more beneficial effect with significant interaction between the two. While the nitrotyrosine level in lung tissue was prominent after NO inhalation alone, it was significantly eliminated after breathing a mixture of NO with H2. Furthermore, NO or H2 treatment alone markedly attenuated LPS-induced lung neutrophil recruitment and inflammation, as evidenced by downregulation of lung myeloperoxidase activity, total cells, and polymorphonuclear neutrophils in BALF, as well as proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukins 1β and 6, and high-mobility group box 1) and chemokines (keratinocyte-derived chemokine, macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α and 2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) in BALF. Combination therapy with NO and H2 had a more beneficial effect against lung inflammatory response. Moreover, combination therapy with NO and H2 could more effectively inhibit LPS-induced pulmonary early and late nuclear factor κB activation as well as pulmonary cell apoptosis. In addition, combination treatment with inhaled NO and H2 could also significantly attenuate lung injury in polymicrobial sepsis. Combination therapy with subthreshold concentrations of NO and H2 still had a significantly beneficial effect against lung injury induced by LPS and polymicrobial sepsis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that combination therapy with NO and H2 provides enhanced therapeutic efficacy for ALI.

Low motility can be caused by a variety factors including abnormal spermatogenesis, oxidative damage, or depletion of intracellular ATP. Recent findings indicate that hydrogen molecule (H2) selectively reduces toxic reactive oxygen species. In this study, we investigated the effects of H2 on human sperm motility in vitro. Methods: Experimentally damaged sperm suspensions from patients left at room temperature for > 5 days or frozen immediately after ejaculation were used. After exposure with H2, their forward motility was measured with a counting chamber. A time-lapse movie was recorded to analyze sperm swimming speed. Mitochondria were stained with a membrane potential-sensitive dye. Results: H2 treatment significantly improved the rate of forward motility, whereas treatment with nitrogen gas did not. While treatment for 30 min was sufficient to improve motility, it did not affect sperm swimming speed. After 24 h, retreatment with H2 increased the motility again. H2 treatment also increased mitochondrial membrane potential. Forward motility of low motile frozen-thawed sperm from patients significantly improved with cleavage medium containing H2.

Using the mouse optic nerve (MON) WM model, we tested whether hydrogen (H2) in drinking water reduced functional WM ischemic injury. Functional integrity of MON was determined by quantitatively monitoring the area of MON compound action potential (CAP) in vitro. A 60 min period of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) caused prompt loss of the CAP followed by an average 20% recovery. After 10–14 days of H2-water, the CAP area did not disappear during ischemia and recovered to a significantly great extent during reperfusion. Immunostaining of axonal neurofilament also showed significant protection by previous drinking of H2-water. Accumulation of nuclear 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a marker of oxidative DNA damage, was observed mainly in oligodendrocytes after OGD. The level of 8-oxoG and lipid peroxidation after OGD were significantly reduced in optic nerves from H2-water drinking mice. The importance of these observations is that ischemic protection of myelinated CNS WM by drinking H2-water provided partial protection in a novel manner, suggesting oxidative stress-resistance and intriguing therapeutic options.",Positive,Mouse,Brain,Brain Injury,Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) Injury,Water (Dissolved),Neutral,Ingestion,,,Japan

No any processing in group I. In group II, the anterior descending branch was only exposed but not ligated. Myocardial I/R was induced by occlusion of anterior descending branch of left coronary artery for 30 min followed by 12 h and 24 h of reperfusion with Bimbaum. Hydrogen-rich saline 1 ml/100 g were injected intraperitoneally 5 min before reperfusion in group IV. Normal saline 1 ml/100 g were injected intraperitoneally 5 min before reperfusion in group V. The rats were sacrificed at 12 h and 24 h of reperfusion and hearts were removed. The pathological changes of myocardial tissue were detected by HE staining. The rate of cardiomyocyte autophagy were detected by the MDC fluorescent dye and flow cytometry instrument. The expression of AMPK, mTOR, Beclin1, LC3 in myocardial tissue was investigated by Western blot. Result: Compared with groups I and II, the rate of cardiomyocyte autophagy, the expression of AMPK, mTOR, Beclin1, LC3 in myocardial tissue were significantly increased at 12 h, 24 h in groups III, IV and V (F = 23.45, 26.65, 25.58; F = 23.16, 25.15, 27.85; F = 21.04, 24.83, 27.43; F = 22.15, 25.79, 29.05; F = 22.58, 27.25, 28.46), P < 0.05.

In present work, rodent renal CaOx crystal deposition model was introduced by intra-abdominal injection of glyoxylate (100 mg/kg/d) for 5 days. Two days before administration of glyoxylate, inhalation of H2 for 30 min per day was initiated and continued for 7 days. By the end of the study, the samples of 24 hours urine, serum and renal tissue were collected for biochemical and pathological assay. According to levels of urine calcium excretion, renal calcium deposition, a serum excretion of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) assay and a TUNEL assay, inhalation of H2 could successfully decrease the CaOx crystallizations and protect against renal injury. Crystal deposition in the kidneys is associated with oxidative stress, which was indicated by increased levels of renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT). These effects were reversed by a high-dose H2 pretreatment. The renal expressions of osteopontin (OPN), CD44, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were markedly increased in glyoxylate-treated mice, and H2 significantly attenuated the increase of OPN, CD44 and MCP-1 but upregulated the expression of IL-10.

However, the therapeutic mechanism of molecular hydrogen remains unclear. We previously reported mitigation of light-induced damage in the rat retina by intraperitoneal injection of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS). In the present study, we investigated whether Sirtuin Type 1 (Sirt1), a class III histone deacetylase, mediates the retinal protective effect of HRS in rats with light-induced retinal damage.Methods: Rats were treated with HRS for 5 days after intense light exposure, and then ERGs were performed and retinas were collected to evaluate the effect of HRS on Sirt1 expression. The necessity of Sirt1 for the retinal protective effect of HRS was investigated using the Sirt1 activator resveratrol, the Sirt1 inhibitor EX-527, and short interfering RNAs. Results: In light-damaged retinas, 5 days of HRS treatment increased Sirt1 expression, mitigated a- and b-wave amplitude reduction, and decreased the reduction of outer nuclear cell layers. The Sirt1 activator resveratrol mimicked the effect of HRS in light-damaged retinas. This result supported our hypothesis that Sirt1 mediates the protective effect of HRS. Additionally, the retinal protective effect of HRS was inhibited by both the Sirt1 inhibitor EX-527 and Sirt1 targeted short interfering RNAs. Hydrogen-rich saline also increased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression and the activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). Conversely, HRS decreased Bcl2-associated X protein expression, cleaved caspase-3, and oxidant-stress product malondialdehyde (MDA) in a Sirt1-dependent manner.

However, because the related mechanisms remain unclear, we investigated carcinostatic mechanisms of the combined treatment with H2 + Pt-nc. Significant suppression of cell proliferation was confirmed at 52 h following combined treatment, and the similar effect was also observed by the 30- or 40-min transient treatment with H2 + Pt-nc. The transient treatments led to changes in cell size and morphology, loss of microvilli, and apoptosis-like cell death at 120 h after treatment. Moreover, transient combined treatment with H2 + Pt-nc induced cell cycle arrest, as reflected by decreased proportions of G1-phase cells and accumulation of G2/M-phase cells. In contrast, intracellular peroxide levels were temporarily and significantly increased immediately after H2 + Pt-nc treatment but not after treatment with H2 or Pt-nc alone. Additionally, combined treatment-induced carcinostatic effects were significantly diminished in the presence of catalase, and marked hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation was confirmed after mixing Pt-nc into cell culture media containing a high concentration of H2. These changes are in agreement with the results that carcinostatic effects were induced after only 40 min of treatment with H2 + Pt-nc.

Recent studies have revealed that hydrogen-rich saline (HS) exerted multiple neuroprotective properties in many neurological diseases including SAH, involved to anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effect. We have previously reported that HS could attenuate neuronal apoptosis as well as vasospasm. However, the underlying mechanism of HS on inflammation in SAH-induced EBI remains unclear. In this study, we explored the influence of HS on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome at early stage after SAH, by injecting HS intraperitoneally to SAH rats. One hundred and twenty-nine SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham group, SAH group, SAH+vehicle group, and SAH+HS group. SAH model was conducted using endovascular perforation method; all rats were sacrificed at 24 h after SAH. Protein level of pIκBα, cytosolic and nuclear p65, NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), caspase-1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and cleaved caspase-3 were measured by western blot. mRNA level of IL-1β, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-c (TNF-α) were evaluated by RT-PCR. Cellular injury and death was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Nissl staining, respectively. Our results showed that pIκBα, nuclear p65, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1β, cleaved caspase-3 proteins, as well as the mRNA of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-ɑ increased at 24 h after SAH, while cytosolic p65 decreased. TUNEL and Nissl staining presented severe cellular injury at 24 h post-SAH. However, after HS administration, the changes mentioned above were reversed. In conclusion, HS may inhibit inflammation in EBI and improve neurobehavioral outcome after SAH, partially via inactivation of NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome. Graphical Abstract Schematic representation of the mechanism of HS-mediated anti-inflammatory effect in EBI after SAH. The NF-κB inflammatory pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome are involved in the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of HS post-SAH. SAH-induced oxidative stress enhances the activation of NF-κB, thus promoting the translocation of p65 subunit into nucleus and increasing the mRNA level of its downstream proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IN-6, TNF-α) and NLRP3. Elevated expression of NLRP3 mRNA increases the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, oxidative stress after SAH stimulates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, therefore, promoting caspase-1 activation and the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β. Finally, activation of NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome contribute to the inflammation response and cellular injury in EBI after SAH. HS treatment reversed the detrimental effect mentioned above via inactivation of NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome.

Peroxynitrite is a critical determinant in nociceptive process. Peroxynitrite inactivates iron-sulfur cluster that results in mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of iron, leading to mitochondrial iron accumulation. Iron accumulation mediated by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) plays a key role in N-methyl-D-aspartate neurotoxicity. This study aims to determine whether peroxynitrite contributes to remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia via DMT1-mediated iron accumulation. Methods: Behavior testing was performed in rat model at different time points. Three-nitrotyrosine, nitrated manganese superoxide dismutase, and DMT1 with/without iron-responsive element [DMT1(+)IRE and DMT1(-)IRE] in spinal cord were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Spinal iron concentration was measured using the Perl stain and atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Hydrogen-rich saline imparting selectivity for peroxynitrite decomposition and iron chelator was applied in mechanistic study on the roles of peroxynitrite and iron, as well as the prevention of hyperalgesia. Results: Remifentanil induced thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia at postoperative 48 h. Compared with control, there were higher levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (mean ± SD, hyperalgesia vs. control, 1.22 ± 0.18 vs. 0.25 ± 0.05, n = 4), nitrated manganese superoxide dismutase (1.01 ± 0.1 vs. 0.19 ± 0.03, n = 4), DMT1(-)IRE (1.42 ± 0.19 vs. 0.33 ± 0.06, n = 4), and iron concentration (12.87 ± 1.14 vs. 5.26 ± 0.61 μg/g, n = 6) in remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia, while DMT1(+)IRE was unaffected. Eliminating peroxynitrite with hydrogen-rich saline protected against hyperalgesia and attenuated DMT1(-)IRE overexpression and iron accumulation. Iron chelator prevented hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: Our study identifies that spinal peroxynitrite activates DMT1(-)IRE, leading to abnormal iron accumulation in remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia, while providing the rationale for the development of molecular hydrogen and 'iron-targeted' therapies.

H2 is usually administered by inhaling H2-containing air (HCA) or by oral intake of H2-rich water (HRW). Despite mounting evidence, the molecular mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects and the optimal method of H2 administration remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether H2 affects signaling pathways and gene expression in a dosage- or dose regimen-dependent manner. We first examined the H2 concentrations in blood and organs after its administration and found that oral intake of HRW rapidly but transiently increased H2 concentrations in the liver and atrial blood, while H2 concentrations in arterial blood and the kidney were one-tenth of those in the liver and atrial blood. In contrast, inhalation of HCA increased H2 equally in both atrial and arterial blood. We next examined whether H2 alters gene expression in normal mouse livers using DNA microarray analysis after administration of HCA and HRW. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that H2 suppressed the expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-regulated genes. Western blot analysis showed that H2 attenuated ERK, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB signaling in mouse livers. Finally, we evaluated whether the changes in gene expression were influenced by the route of H2 administration and found that the combination of both HRW and HCA had the most potent effects on signaling pathways and gene expression in systemic organs, suggesting that H2 may act not only through a dose-dependent mechanism but also through a complex molecular network.

Low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR(-/-)) mice fed an atherogenic-diet were dosed daily with H2 and/or simvastatin. In vitro studies were carried out in oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL)-stimulated macrophage-derived foam cell model treated with or without H2. H2 or simvastatin significantly enhanced plaque stability by increasing levels of collagen and smooth muscle cells, as well as reducing macrophage and lipid levels in plaques. The decreased numbers of dendritic cells and increased numbers of regulatory T cells in plaques further supported the stabilizing effect of H2 or simvastatin. Moreover, H2 treatment decreased serum ox-LDL level and apoptosis in plaques with concomitant inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and reduction of ROS accumulation in the aorta. In vitro, like ERS inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid, H2 inhibited ox-LDL- or tunicamycin (an ERS inducer)-induced ERS response and cell apoptosis. In addition, like ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine, H2 inhibited ox-LDL- or Cu(2+) (an ROS inducer)-induced reduction in cell viability and increase in cellular ROS. Also, H2 increased Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2, an important factor in antioxidant signaling) activation and Nrf2 siRNA abolished the protective effect of H2 on ox-LDL-induced cellular ROS production. The inhibitory effects of H2 on the apoptosis of macrophage-derived foam cells, which take effect by suppressing the activation of ERS pathway and by activating Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, might lead to an improvement in atherosclerotic plaque stability.

Hydrogen can exert potent protective cellular effects via reduction in oxidative stress in various diseases. The present study investigated whether long-term hydrogen treatment can improve neurological function outcome in the SHRSP model, and the effects of hydrogen on BBB function, especially the oxidative stress and the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in this model. Fifty-six animals were randomly assigned to 2 groups and treated as follows: SHRSP treated with hydrogen-rich water (HRW) (HRW group, n = 28); and SHRSP treated with regular water (control group, n = 28). The effect of HRW on overall survival and neurological function, and the effects of HRW on reactive oxygen species, BBB function, and MMP activities were examined. HRW treatment improved neurological function and tended to improve overall survival but without significant difference. The numbers of bleeds and infarcts were lower in the cortex and hippocampus in the HRW group. The HRW group exhibited a significantly lower number of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine-positive cells and vessels of extravasated albumin in the hippocampus compared with the control group. MMP-9 activity was reduced in the hippocampus in the HRW group compared with the control group. The present study suggests that ingestion of HRW can improve neurological function outcome in the SHRSP model. This beneficial effect may be due to attenuation of BBB disruption via reduction in reactive oxygen species and suppression of MMP-9 activity in the hippocampus.",Positive,Rat,Brain,Stroke,Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) Injury,Water (Dissolved),Neutral,Ingestion,,,Japan

Cardiac dysfunction complicating sepsis is one of the most important causes of this mortality. This dysfunction is due to myocardial inflammation and reduced production of energy by the heart. A number of studies have shown that hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) has a beneficial effect on sepsis. Therefore, we tested whether HRS prevents cardiac dysfunction by increasing cardiac energy. Four groups of rats received intraperitoneal injections of one of the following solutions: normal saline (NS), HRS, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and LPS plus HRS. Cardiac function was measured by echocardiography 8 h after the injections. Gene and protein expression related to fatty acid oxidation (FAO) were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis. The injection of LPS compromised heart function through decreased fractional shortening (FS) and increased left ventricular diameter (LVD). The addition of HRS increased FS, palmitate triphosphate, and the ratio of phosphocreatinine (PCr) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as well as decreasing LVD. The LPS challenge reduced the expression of genes related to FAO, including perioxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), perioxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), and their downstream targets, in mRNA and protein level, which were attenuated by HRS.

Most previous studies of the neuroprotective effects of hydrogen-rich water on TBI primarily focused on antioxidant effects. The present study investigated whether hydrogen-rich water (HRW) could attenuate brain damage and inflammation after traumatic brain injury in rats. A TBI model was induced using a controlled cortical impact injury. HRW or distilled water was injected intraperitoneally daily following surgery. We measured survival rate, brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and neurological dysfunction in all animals. Changes in inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory cells and Cho/Cr metabolites in brain tissues were also detected. Our results demonstrated that TBI-challenged rats exhibited significant brain injuries that were characterized by decreased survival rate and increased BBB permeability, brain edema, and neurological dysfunction, while HRW treatment ameliorated the consequences of TBI. HRW treatment also decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and HMGB1), inflammatory cell number (Iba1) and inflammatory metabolites (Cho) and increased the levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in the brain tissues of TBI-challenged rats. In conclusion, HRW could exert a neuroprotective effect against TBI and attenuate inflammation, which suggests HRW as an effective therapeutic strategy for TBI patients.

We previous showed that DHCA treated rats developed a significant oxidative stress and apoptosis in neurons. We here intend to investigate the protective the effect of hydrogen against oxidative stress-induced cell injury and the involved mechanisms using an in vitro experimental model of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) on HT-22 cells. The model of H/R was established using an airtight culture container and the anaeropack. Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was used H2DCFDA and JC-1 staining. Western blot was used for the quantification of Akt, p-Akt, Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 proteins. The microRNA (miRNA) profile in hippocampal neurons from rat model of DHCA was determined by miRNA deep sequencing. The elevation of ROS and reduction of MMP were significantly induced by the treatment with hypoxia for 18 h followed by reoxygenation for 6 h. Hydrogen treatment significantly reduced H/R-caused cell death. The levels of p-Akt (Ser 473) and Bcl-2 were significantly increased while Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were decreased by hydrogen treatment on the model of H/R. The expression of miR-200 family was significantly elevated in model of DHCA and H/R. Hydrogen administration inhibited the H/R-induced expression of miR-200 family in HT-22 cells. In addition, inhibition of miR-200 family suppressed H/R-caused cell death through reducing ROS production. These results suggest that H/R causes oxidative stress-induced cell death and that the hydrogen protects against H/R-induced cell death in HT22 cells, in part, due to reducing expression of miR-200 family. © 2015 S.

The aim of present study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of hydrogen molecule on streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy in mice. Methods: Diabetes was induced in adult male mice by consecutive peritoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. Then, they were treated with hydrogen water (1.3±0.2 mg/l) for 8 weeks (four groups, n=83-88 in each group). Results: Although treatment of diabetic mice with hydrogen water did not significantly affect blood glucose level, it significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and reduced expression of atrial natriuretic factor and β-myosin heavy chain; it alleviated cardiac fibrosis and reduced expression of collagen I and III, transforming growth factor beta, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and osteopontin; it reduced cardiac caspase-3 activity and ratio of bax/bcl-2. Importantly, hydrogen water treatment improved cardiac function in streptozotocin-diabetic mice. Furthermore, it was found that hydrogen water treatment abated oxidative stress, suppressed inflammation, and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress in the hearts of streptozotocin-diabetic mice. In addition, hydrogen water treatment suppressed activation of Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase signaling and nuclear factor κB signaling in the hearts of streptozotocin-diabetic mice. Conclusion: Treatment with hydrogen molecule attenuated cardiac dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, which was independent of glycemic control. Summary: Treatment with hydrogen molecule attenuated cardiac dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice.

However, OLV can cause lung injury during the surgical process and becomes an important factor affecting the outcomes. To date, effective treatments for the prevention of lung injury caused by OLV are lacking. Hydrogen has been demonstrated to have effective protection against tissue injuries caused by oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This study investigated the efficacy of hydrogen water consumption on the prevention of lung injury induced by OLV in rats. Materials and methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 32, 240-260 g) were divided randomly into the following four groups: sham group, sham + H2 group, OLV group, OLV + H2 group. The rats drank hydrogen water or degassed hydrogen water for 4 wk before the operation and received OLV for 60 min and two-lung ventilation for 60 min. Lung tissues were assayed for wet-to-dry ratio, oxidative stress variables, proinflammatory cytokines, and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Results: Hydrogen water consumption reduced wet-to-dry weight ratio, malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase activity and decreased the concentration of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the lung tissues compared with sham group and sham + H2 group. Hydrogen water consumption further attenuated NF-κB activation and caused histopathologic alterations. Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that hydrogen water consumption ameliorated OLV-induced lung injury, and it may exert its protective role by its anti-inflammation, antioxidation and reducing NF-κB activity in the lung tissues.

Oxidative stress occurs when cellular production of reactive oxygen species outweighs the protective capacity of antioxidant defences. Reactive oxygen species are generated as by-products of cellular metabolism, primarily in the mitochondria. Herein, we present a novel investigation of the effects of molecular hydrogen (H2) on retinal cells exposed to oxidative stress.Methods We cultured adult rat retinal tissues in an organotypic culture system with a nitric oxide donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, in the presence or absence of H2. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis of retinal cells were analysed using a MitoTMRE detection kit and TUNEL assay, respectively. Tyrosine nitration levels and oxidative stress damage in the retina were evaluated using immunohistochemical staining. Retinal damage was quantified by measuring the numbers of cells in the ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers and the thickness of the retina.ResultsH2 suppressed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis in retinal cells. Moreover, H2 decreased the tyrosine nitration level and suppressed oxidative stress damage in retinal cells. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine treatment decreased the cell numbers in the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer, but the presence of H2 inhibited this reduction. These findings suggest that H2 has a neuroprotective effect against retinal cell oxidative damage, presumably by scavenging peroxynitrite.ConclusionsH2 reduces cellular peroxynitrite, a highly toxic reactive nitrogen species.

In the lactulose-treated group, excessive increases in inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, were inhibited significantly. Increased heme oxygenase-1 and superoxide dismutase 2 expression were also observed after lactulose treatment. The antibiotics suppressed the regeneration-promoting effect of lactulose by reducing hydrogen production, whereas supplementing hydrogen by hydrogen-rich saline would get a similar regeneration-promoting effect as lactulose administration. Lactulose administration accelerates posthepatectomized liver regeneration in rats by inducing hydrogen, which may result from attenuation of the oxidative stress response and excessive inflammatory response.

DPN affects up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and there are currently no efficacious therapeutic strategies available for its treatment. Previous studies have reported that oxidative stress and poly(ADP‑ribose) polymerase‑1 (PARP‑1) may be unifying factors for hyperglycemic injury. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of hydrogen‑rich medium (HM) on high glucose (HG)‑mediated oxidative stress, PARP‑1 activation and the apoptosis of Schwann cells (SCs) in vitro. The cells were divided into different groups, and were treated for 48 h. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using Cell Counting kit‑8 and annexin V/propidium iodide assays, respectively. The concentrations of 8‑hydroxy‑2‑deoxyguanosine (8‑OHdG) and peroxynitrite (ONOO‑) were detected using an enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. The presence of intracellular oxygen free radicals was confirmed using flow cytometric analysis. Colorimetric assays were performed to determine the activity of caspase‑3, and western blotting was performed to detect the protein expression levels of PARP‑1, cleaved PARP‑1, PAR, apoptosis‑inducing factor (AIF), B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) and Bcl‑2‑associated X protein. HG was found to induce severe oxidative stress and promote the caspase‑dependent and caspase‑independent apoptosis of SCs. Treatment with HM inhibited HG‑induced oxidative stress by suppressing hydroxyl and ONOO‑ production, levels of 8‑OHdG, caspase‑3 activity and apoptosis in the SCs. Furthermore, treatment with HM downregulated the HG‑induced release of PAR, the activation of PARP‑1 and nuclear translocation of AIF, and upregulated the expression of Bcl‑2 in the SCs. These results indicated that HM inhibited the HG‑induced‑oxidative stress‑associated caspase‑dependent and caspase‑independent apoptotic pathways in SCs. Therefore, HM may have potential as a treatment for DPN.",Positive,Cell Culture,Brain,Diabetes,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,Medium (Dissolved),Neutral,Culture Media,,,China

Endotheliocytes were inoculated on 6-well plates and randomly divided into 4 groups: control, H2, LPS, LPS+H2, H2, and LPS+H2 in saturated hydrogen-rich medium. We applied Wright's stain-ing to observe conglutination of hyaline leukocytes and HUVECs, flow cytometry to determine the content of vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the E-selectin concentration in the cell liquor, the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) to test the permeability of endothelial cells, and Western blot and im-munofluorescence to test the expression and distribution of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. Compared with control cells, there was an increase in endothelium-hyaline leukocyte conglutination, a reduction in VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin, and the TEER value increased obviously. Compared with LPS, there was an obvious reduction in the conglutination of LPS+H2 cells, a reduction in VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin levels, and a reduction in the TEER-resistance value, while the expression of VE-cadherin increased. Fluorescence results showed that, compared with control cells, the VE-cadherin in LPS cells was in-complete at the cell joints. Compared with LPS cells, the VE-cadherin in LPS+H2 cells was even and complete at the cell joints. Liquid rich in hydrogen could reduce LPS-induced production of adhesion molecules and endothelium-hyaline leukocyte conglutination, and influence the expression and distribution of VE-cadherin to regulate the permeability of the endothelium.",Positive,Cell Culture,Endothelium,Sepsis,Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS),Medium (Dissolved),Neutral,Culture Media,,,China

Methods: Ninety healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, TBI group and hydrogen rich water treatment group (HW group), with 30 rats in each group. TBI model was reproduced by the modified Feeney weight dropping method. The skulls of rats in sham operation group underwent only craniotomy without direct hit. The rats in HW group received brain injury by hitting after craniotomy, followed by injection of hydrogen rich water (5 mL/kg) intraperitoneally once a day for 5 days after successful reproduction of the model. The rats in sham operation group and TBI group were given an equal amount of normal saline in same manner. Six rats from each group were sacrificed at 6, 12, 24, 48 hours and 5 days after evaluating neurological severity scores (NSS). The brain tissue in injured ipsilateral cortex was harvested. The activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and content of malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined by spectrophotometry. The expressions of mRNA and nucleoprotein of Nrf2 were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western Blot. The pathological changes were observed with microscopy after hematoxylin and cosin (HE) staining. Results: (1) NSS score: compared with TBI group, NSS in HW group at 12, 24, 48 hours and 5 days were significantly decreased (12 hours: 9.83 ± 2.32 vs. 13.17 ± 2.71, 24 hours: 9.83 ± 2.79 vs. 13.50 ± 2.43, 48 hours: 7.50 ± 2.07 vs. 11.83 ± 2.14, 5 days: 5.50 ± 1.87 vs. 10.50 ± 2.43, all P < 0.05). (2) Compared with sham operation group, the activity of GSH-Px and CAT in TBI group were markedly declined after operation, while the MDA content was elevated significantly, especially at 24 hours [CAT (kU/g): 1.080 ± 0.312 vs. 3.571 ± 0.758, GSH-Px (kU/g): 9.195 ± 3.173 vs. 32.385 ± 10.619; MDA (µmol/g): 12.282 ± 2.896 vs. 4.349 ± 1.511, all P < 0.01]. Compared with TBI group, the parameters in HW group were improved, and they were similar as sham operation group. (3) RT-qPCR: no significant difference was found in the expression of Nrf2 mRNA at each time point in three groups. (4) Western Blot: the expression of Nrf2 nucleoprotein (gray value) in TBI group was apparently higher than that in sham operation group, and peaked at 24 hours (0.703 ± 0.262 vs. 0.238 ± 0.120, P < 0.05), and the expression in HW group was obviously higher than that in TBI group, especially at 24 hours (1.110 ± 0.372 vs. 0.703 ± 0.262, P < 0.05). (5) HE staining: the brain structure in sham operation group was found to be intact. However, there were different degrees of pathological changes at each time in TBI group, especially at 24 hours. The pathological damage of brain tissue in HW group was significantly milder. Conclusions: Hydrogen rich water can up-regulate the expression of Nrf2, and reduce oxidative damage of traumatic brain injury in rats. Nrf2 can up-regulate the expression of its downstream antioxidant enzymes, which may be the mechanism of the upregulation expression of Nrf2 in the study.

Hydrogen-rich saline provides a high concentration of hydrogen that can be easily and safely applied. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) has been the most curative therapy for hematological malignancies. However, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is the main cause of death in post-transplantation patients. In this study, we examined whether hydrogen-rich saline would show favorable effects on acute GVHD in mice. Material and methods: After lethal irradiation, BALB/c mice received bone marrow transplantation from C57BL/6 mice. Hydrogen-rich saline (5 ml/kg) was given to recipient mice in the hydrogen group once a day by intraperitoneal injection, and saline (5 ml/kg) was given to recipient mice in the saline group. Survival rates were monitored, clinical and pathological scores of aGVHD were determined after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and the serum cytokine levels were examined on the 7th day after BMT. Results: This study proves that hydrogen-rich saline increased the survival rate, reduced clinical and histopathological scores of aGVHD, promoted the recovery of white blood cells, reduced the serum cytokine levels, and reversed tissue damage after transplantation in mice. Conclusions: Hydrogen has potential as an effective and safe therapeutic agent in aGVHD.

A total of 150 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were selected and divided randomly into 5 groups of normal control (I), sham operation (II), myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (III), hydrogen-rich saline (IV) and normal saline group (V) (n = 30 each). Group I had no treatment at all. In group II, anterior descending branch was merely exposed but not ligated. Myocardial I/R was induced by 30-min occlusion of anterior descending branch of left coronary artery followed by 12/24 h reperfusion of Bimbaum. Hydrogen-rich saline 1 ml/100 g were injected intraperitoneally 5 min before reperfusion in group IV. Normal saline 1 ml/100 g was injected intraperitoneally 5 min before reperfusion in group V. The values of ± dp/dt max, left ventricular diastolic pressure (LVDP) and left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) during the procedure were recorded by BL-420 biological function experimental system at pre-ischemia, ischemia 30 min, 60 min and 120 min of reperfusion. The animals were sacrificed at 60 min, 120 min of reperfusion and hearts harvested. The pathological changes of myocardial tissue were detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. And the expressions of Akt and GSK3β in myocardial tissue were examined by Western blot. Compared with groups I and II, the values of ± dp/dt max, LVDP and LVSP significantly increased. And the expressions of Akt and GSK3β in myocardial tissue significantly increased in groups III, IV and V. Compared with groups III and V, the values of ± dp/dt max, LVDP and LVSP significantly decreased. And the expressions of Akt and GSK3β in myocardial tissue significantly decreased in group IV.

This study was to investigate the hypothesis that hydrogen could ameliorate CLP-induced lung injury in rats. Methods and results: Our experiments exhibited that gas exchange dysfunction and lung tissue inflammation were observed in animals exposed to CLP. Hydrogen-rich saline treatment significantly attenuated lung injury as indicated by significantly improved gas exchange and histological changes in the lung and significantly reduced lung water content (LWC) and neutrophil infiltration 8h after CLP. Lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidation in the lung tissue were significantly reduced along with a decreased nitrotyrosine content and maintained superoxide dismutase activity in the presence of hydrogen, demonstrating antioxidant role of hydrogen in CLP-induced ALI. Importantly, hydrogen-rich saline treatment significantly inhibited the activation of p-p38 and NF-κB while suppressing the production of several proinflammatory mediators. Conclusions: This observation indicated that hydrogen-rich saline peritoneal injection improves histological and functional assessment in rat model of CLP-induced ALI. The therapeutic effects of hydrogen-rich saline may be related to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of hydrogen inhalation on liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. The portal triad to the left lobe and the left middle lobe of the liver were completely occluded for 90 min. This was followed by reperfusion for 180 min. The rats subsequently underwent syngeneic orthotopic liver transplantation. Inhalation of various concentrations (1, 2 and 3%) of hydrogen gas and its administration for different durations (1, 3 and 6 h) immediately prior to the I/R injury allowed the optimal dose and duration of administration to be determined. Liver injury was evaluated through biochemical and histopathological examinations. The expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Liver nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) was detected by qPCR and western blot analysis. Inhalation of hydrogen gas at 2% concentration for 1 h significantly reduced the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, the expression of cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) and IL-1β, and morphological damage. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression levels of NF-κB, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and zinc finger protein A20 (A20) in rats where only the donors received hydrogen were significantly increased compared with those in rats where both the donor and recipient, or only the recipient received hydrogen. The results indicate that hydrogen inhalation at 2% concentration for 1 h prior to liver transplantation protected the rats from ischemia/reperfusion injury by activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.",Positive,Rat,Liver,Surgery/Transplantation,Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) Injury,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,China

HRW could significantly decrease the serum alanine aminotransferase level (24 h: 4442 ± 714.3 U/L vs 6909 ± 304.8 U/L, P < 0.01; 48 h: 3782 ± 557.5 U/L vs 5111 ± 404 U/L, P < 0.01; and 3255 ± 337.4 U/L vs 3814 ± 250.2 U/L, P < 0.05, respectively) and aspartate aminotransferase level (24 h: 4683 ± 443.4 U/L vs 5307 ± 408.4 U/L, P < 0.05; 48 h: 3392 ± 377.6 U/L vs 4458 ± 423.6 U/L, P < 0.01; and 3354 ± 399.4 U/L vs 3778 ± 358 U/L, respectively) compared with the APAP treatment group. The alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels had the same result. Seventy-two hours after APAP administration, liver samples were collected for pathological examination and serum was collected to detect the cytokine levels. The liver index (5.16% ± 0.26% vs 5.88% ± 0.073%, P < 0.05) and percentage of liver necrosis area (27.73% ± 0.58% vs 36.87% ± 0.49%, P < 0.01) were significantly lower in the HRW-treated animals. The malonyldialdehyde (MDA) contents were significantly reduced in the HRW pretreatment group, but they were increased in the APAP-treated group (10.44 ± 1.339 nmol/mg protein vs 16.70 ± 1.646 nmol/mg protein, P < 0.05). A decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the APAP treatment group and an increase of SOD in the HRW treatment group were also detected (9.74 ± 0.46 U/mg protein vs 12.1 ± 0.67 U/mg protein, P < 0.05). Furthermore, HRW could significantly increase the glutathione (GSH) contents (878.7 ± 76.73 mg/g protein vs 499.2 ± 48.87 mg/g protein) compared with the APAP treatment group. Meanwhile, HRW could reduce the inflammation level (serum TNF-α: 399.3 ± 45.50 pg/L vs 542.8 ± 22.38 pg/L, P < 0.05; and serum IL-6: 1056 ± 77.01 pg/L vs 1565 ± 42.11 pg/L, P < 0.01, respectively). In addition, HRW could inhibit 4-HNE, nitrotyrosine formation, JNK phosphorylation, connexin 32 and cytochrome P4502E expression. Simultaneously, HRW could facilitate hepatocyte mitosis to promote liver regeneration. Conclusion: HRW has significant therapeutic potential in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation and promoting liver regeneration.

Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase causes inflammation, and proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress induce autophagy, a catabolic mechanism responsible for protein degradation and recycling of damaged proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. If not controlled, excessive autophagy responses can result in cell death. In this study, we pretreated rats with saturated hydrogen saline, and examined the molecular mechanism by which saturated hydrogen saline attenuates LPS-induced acute lung dysfunction. Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups-a control group, an LPS group, or an LPS plus saturated hydrogen saline (LPS + H2) group. Treatment with saturated hydrogen saline prolonged the median survival time of rats and reduced lung dysfunction induced by LPS. Moreover, saturated hydrogen saline significantly attenuated LPS-mediated induction of serum tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6, myeloperoxidase, and malondialdehyde (P < 0.05). Autophagosomes were found in the cytoplasm of type II alveolar epithelial cells of LPS-treated rats, and light chain 3 protein (LC3)I/II was increased by LPS treatment. In contrast, saturated hydrogen saline decreased the number of autophagosomes and LC3I/II expression. Saturated hydrogen saline also attenuated the LPS-mediated increase in apoptosis and p38 expression. Taken together, saturated hydrogen saline may attenuate LPS-induced acute lung dysfunction in rats by reducing inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis involving the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of hydrogen-rich saline in promoting nerve regeneration after 10-mm sciatic nerve autografting in rats. The rats were randomly divided into two groups and intraperitoneally administered a daily regimen of 5 ml/kg hydrogen-rich or normal saline. Axonal regeneration and functional recovery were assessed through a combination of behavioral analyses, electrophysiological evaluations, Fluoro-Gold™ retrograde tracings and histomorphological observations. The data showed that rats receiving hydrogen-rich saline achieved better axonal regeneration and functional recovery than those receiving normal saline.

Hydrogen (H2) has been proved effective on reducing oxidative stress or improving HDL functionalities in animal models or metabolic syndrome volunteers. This study was undertaken to explore the effects of CS exposure on reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and the antioxidative effects of H2 treatment against CS exposure in mice transgenic for human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). Methods [3H]-cholesterol-laden macrophages were injected intraperitoneally into mice, and the samples of blood, bile, liver, and feces were collected for radioactivity determination to evaluate RCT. [3H]-cholesterol-laden macrophages were incubated with HDL isolated from different groups of mice, and the samples of cell medium supernatants were collected for evaluating the HDL functionality to elicit cholesterol efflux. Results CS exposure significantly decreased plasma HDL cholesterol level (HDL-C) by 22 % and increased LDL cholesterol level (LDL-C) by 21 % compared with the control group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), while H2 treatment significantly improved the CS-impaired levels of TC, LDL-C and HDL-C by 10, 27 and 31 %, respectively, compared with the CS group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05).

Acute neuronal death during I/R has been attributed to loss of mitochondrial permeability transition coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction. This study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of hydrogen-rich saline on neuronal mitochondrial injury from global cerebral I/R in rats. Materials and methods: We used a four-vessel occlusion model of global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, with Sprague–Dawley rats. The rats were divided randomly into six groups (n = 90): sham (group S), I/R (group I/R), normal saline (group NS), atractyloside (group A), hydrogen-rich saline (group H), and hydrogen-rich saline + atractyloside (group HA). In groups H and HA, intraperitoneal hydrogen-rich saline (5 mL/kg) was injected immediately after reperfusion, whereas the equal volume of NS was injected in the other four groups. In groups A and HA, atractyloside (15 μL) was intracerebroventricularly injected 10 min before reperfusion, whereas groups NS and H received equal NS. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by spectrophotometry. Cytochrome c protein expression in the mitochondria and cytoplasm was detected by western blot. The hippocampus mitochondria ultrastructure was examined with transmission electron microscope. The histologic damage in hippocampus was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: Hydrogen-rich saline treatment significantly improved the amount of surviving cells (P < 0.05). Furthermore, hydrogen-rich saline not only reduced tissue damage, the degree of mitochondrial swelling, and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential but also preserved the mitochondrial cytochrome c content (P < 0.05).

Acute TBI can transform into a chronic condition and be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, probably through induction of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Here, we examined the ability of the antioxidant molecular hydrogen given in drinking water (molecular hydrogen water; mHW) to alter the acute changes induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI), a commonly used experimental model of TBI. We found that mHW reversed CCI-induced edema by about half, completely blocked pathological tau expression, accentuated an early increase seen in several cytokines but attenuated that increase by day 7, reversed changes seen in the protein levels of aquaporin-4, HIF-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9, but not for amyloid beta peptide 1-40 or 1-42. Treatment with mHW also reversed the increase seen 4 h after CCI in gene expression related to oxidation/carbohydrate metabolism, cytokine release, leukocyte or cell migration, cytokine transport, ATP and nucleotide binding. Finally, we found that mHW preserved or increased ATP levels and propose a new mechanism for mHW, that of ATP production through the Jagendorf reaction. These results show that molecular hydrogen given in drinking water reverses many of the sequelae of CCI and suggests that it could be an easily administered, highly effective treatment for TBI.

We investigated the protective effects and mechanisms of three different hydrogen-rich liquid resuscitation preparations on lung injury-induced uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock (UHS) in rats. Materials and methods A UHS rat model was prepared using the method of Capone et al. of arterial bleeding and tail amputation. Healthy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 7 groups (10/group) to receive: Sham treatment; Ringer’s solution; hydrogen-rich Ringer’s solution (H-Ringer’s solution); hydroxyethyl starch (HES); hydrogen-rich hydroxyethyl starch (H-HES); hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch (HSH); and hydrogen-rich hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch (H-HSH). At 72 hours after successful resuscitation, lung tissue was HE stained to score any pathological changes. We also determined wet-to-dry (W/D) lung weight ratios and lung tissue concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF-α), interleukin -10 (IL-10), and malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities. Results Compared with the Non-H groups, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) accumulation in alveoli in the H groups was significantly reduced (P value), and capillary leakage and wall edema were ameliorated.

Although hydrogen is an established antioxidant, its effect on chronic pain has not been characterized. This study was to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of hydrogen-rich normal saline induced analgesia. Methodology/Principal findings In a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by L5 spinal nerve ligation (L5 SNL), intrathecal injection of hydrogen-rich normal saline relieved L5 SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Importantly, repeated administration of hydrogen-rich normal saline did not lead to tolerance. Preemptive treatment with hydrogen-rich normal saline prevented development of neuropathic pain behavior. Immunofluorochrome analysis revealed that hydrogen-rich normal saline treatment significantly attenuated L5 SNL-induced increase of 8-hydroxyguanosine immunoreactive cells in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn. Western blot analysis of SDS/PAGE-fractionated tyrosine-nitrated proteins showed that L5 SNL led to increased expression of tyrosine-nitrated Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the spinal cord, and hydrogen-rich normal saline administration reversed the tyrosine-nitrated MnSOD overexpression. We also showed that the analgesic effect of hydrogen-rich normal saline was associated with decreased activation of astrocytes and microglia, attenuated expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the spinal cord. Conclusion/Significance Intrathecal injection of hydrogen-rich normal saline produced analgesic effect in neuropathic rat.

In the present study, we investigated whether double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a by-product of RNA virus replication, can induce human β-defensins-2 (hBD-2) expression in oral epithelial cells (OECs). We also examined the hBD-2-inducible activity of acid-electrolyzed functional water (FW). The results indicated that both dsRNA- and FW-induced hBD-2 expression in OECs. The induction efficiency was much higher for FW than for dsRNA. FW-induced production of hBD-2 was clearly observed by immunofluorescence staining. A luciferase assay was performed with 1.2 kb of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the hBD-2 gene. The results indicated that the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-binding site proximal to the translation initiation site was indispensable for dsRNA-stimulated hBD-2 expression, but not in the case of FW. Moreover, FW-stimulated hBD-2 expression did not depend on NF-κB activity; instead, FW inhibited NF-κB activity. Pretreatment of the cells with specific inhibitors against NF-κB further confirmed NF-κB-independent hBD-2 induction by FW. In analogy to the results for intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), the dsRNA signal, but not FW, was sensed by toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in OECs. These results suggested that hBD-2 expression induced by dsRNA and FW is regulated by distinct mechanisms in OECs.",Positive,Cell Culture,Mouth,Wound Healing,Oxidative Stress,"Water, Commercial (Miura Denshi)",Acidic,Culture Media,,,Japan

The pathophysiological process involves oxidative stress and inflammation. Hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. This study explored the protective effect of pretreatment with HRS on the development of glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis acute kidney injury. Materials and methods: Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into four equal groups. Group 1 served as the control, group 2 was given 50% glycerol (10 mL/kg, intramuscular), group 3 was given glycerol after 7 d pretreatment with high dose HRS (10 mL/kg/d, intraperitoneal), and group 4 was given glycerol after 7 d pretreatment with low dose HRS (5 mL/kg/d, intraperitoneal). Renal health was monitored by serum creatinine (Cr), urea, and histologic analysis; rhabdomyolysis was monitored by creatine kinase (CK) levels; and oxidative stress was monitored by kidney tissue reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) levels. Inflammation was monitored by interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) evaluation. Results: Glycerol administration resulted in an increase in the mean histologic damage score, serum Cr, urea and CK, kidney tissue ROS, malondialdehyde, 8-OH-dG, GSH-PX, IL-6, and TNF-α, and a decrease in kidney tissue superoxide dismutase activity. All these factors were significantly improved by both doses of HRS, but the mean histologic damage score, urea, Cr, CK, ROS, 8-OH-dG, GSH-PX, IL-6, and TNF-α for the high dose HRS treatment group were even lower. Conclusions: Pretreatment by HRS ameliorated renal dysfunction in glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis by inhibiting oxidative stress and the inflammatory response.

Here, we examine the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach when H2 inhalation is begun on the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) under normoxic conditions, either alone or in combination with targeted temperature management (TTM). Methods and results: Rats were subjected to 6 minutes of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Five minutes after achieving ROSC, post-cardiac arrest rats were randomized into 4 groups: mechanically ventilated with 26% O2 and normothermia (control); mechanically ventilated with 26% O2, 1.3% H2, and normothermia (H2); mechanically ventilated with 26% O2 and TTM (TTM); and mechanically ventilated with 26% O2, 1.3% H2, and TTM (TTM+H2). Animal survival rate at 7 days after ROSC was 38.4% in the control group, 71.4% in the H2 and TTM groups, and 85.7% in the TTM+H2 group. Combined therapy of TTM and H2 inhalation was superior to TTM alone in terms of neurological deficit scores at 24, 48, and 72 hours after ROSC, and motor activity at 7 days after ROSC. Neuronal degeneration and microglial activation in a vulnerable brain region was suppressed by both TTM alone and H2 inhalation alone, with the combined therapy of TTM and H2 inhalation being most effective. Conclusions: H2 inhalation was beneficial when begun after ROSC, even when delivered in the absence of hyperoxia. Combined TTM and H2 inhalation was more effective than TTM alone.",Positive,Rat,Brain,Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR),Hypoxia-Ischemia,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,Japan

Neuronal apoptosis is involved in the pathological process of EBI. Hydrogen can inhibit neuronal apoptosis and attenuate EBI following SAH. However, the molecular mechanism underlying hydrogen-mediated anti-apoptotic effects in SAH has not been elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate whether hydrogen alleviates EBI after SAH, specifically neuronal apoptosis, partially via the Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 85) were randomly divided into the following groups: sham group (n = 17), SAH group (n = 17), SAH + saline group (n = 17), SAH + hydrogen-rich saline (HS) group (n = 17) and SAH + HS + Ly294002 (n = 17) group. HS or an equal volume of physiological saline was administered immediately after surgery and repeated 8 hours later. The PI3K inhibitor, Ly294002, was applied to manipulate the proposed pathway. Neurological score and SAH grade were assessed at 24 hours after SAH. Western blot was used for the quantification of Akt, pAkt, GSK3β, pGSK3β, Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 proteins. Neuronal apoptosis was identified by double staining of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and NeuN, and quantified by apoptosis index. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent double-labeling staining was performed to clarify the relationships between neuronal apoptosis and pAkt or pGSK3β. Results: HS significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis and improved neurological function at 24 hours after SAH. The levels of pAkt and pGSK3β, mainly expressed in neurons, were markedly up-regulated. Additionally, Bcl-2 was significantly increased while Bax and cleaved caspase-3 was decreased by HS treatment. Double staining of pAkt and TUNEL showed few colocalization of pAkt-positive cells and TUNEL-positive cells. The inhibitor of PI3K, Ly294002, suppressed the beneficial effects of HS. Conclusions: HS could attenuate neuronal apoptosis in EBI and improve the neurofunctional outcome after SAH, partially via the Akt/GSK3β pathway.",Positive,Rat,Brain,Brain Injury,Intracranial Hemorrhage,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

Methods: Three experimental groups were established in male Sprague-Dawley rats: (1) sham group, (2) IR with normal saline group, (3) and IR with HRS group. A rat model of skeletal muscle IR injury was induced by 3-h tourniquet occlusion on its left hind limb and 4-h reperfusion. Normal saline and HRS (1.0 mL/100 g) were administered intraperitoneally at 10 min before reperfusion, respectively. Muscle and serum samples were analyzed for detecting the levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydroxyl radical (•OH). Muscle samples were assessed by wet/dry rate, hematoxylin and eosin histologic assessment, Bcl2, Bax, cytochrome C, LC3B, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling, and electron microscopy. Results: The wet/dry ratio increased significantly in the IR group (P < 0.01 compared with that in the sham group) and decreased significantly in IR with HRS groups (4.12 ± 0.14 versus 4.12 ± 0.14, P < 0.01 compared with that in the IR group). Muscle tissues and serum of the IR group had significantly increased levels of MPO, MDA, •OH content, and decreased SOD activities compared with the sham group (P < 0.01). The activity of SOD in the IR with HRS group was greatly elevated compared with that in the IR group (295.028 ± 9.288 versus 249.190 ± 5.450 in muscle tissues; 91.627 ± 2.604 versus 73.4045 ± 6.487 in serum; P < 0.01), whereas the levels of MPO, MDA, and •OH content were clearly reduced (MPO: 0.5649 ± 0.0724 versus 1.0984 ± 0.0824 in muscle tissues; 0.7257 ± 0.1232 versus 1.3147 ± 0.0531 in serum. MDA: 4.457 ± 0.650 versus 7.107 ± 0.597 in muscle tissues; 2.531 ± 0.434 versus 4.626 ± 0.237 in serum. •OH: 16.451 ± 0.806 versus 19.871 ± 0.594 in muscle tissues; 500.212 ± 7.387 versus 621.352 ± 7.591 in serum, P < 0.01). The integrated optical density of positive amethyst staining increased significantly in the IR group (P < 0.01 compared with that in the sham group) and decreased significantly in IR with HRS group (928.79 ± 234.537 versus 3005.972 ± 83.567, P < 0.01 compared with that in the IR group). Muscle tissues of the IR group had significantly increased levels of Bax, cytochrome C, LC3B content, and decreased Bcl2 activities compared with those in the sham group (P < 0.01). The activity of Bcl2 in the IR with HRS group was greatly elevated compared with that in the IR group (0.2635 ± 0.0704 versus 0.1242 ± 0.0662; P < 0.01), whereas the levels of Bax, cytochrome C, and LC3B content were clearly reduced (Bax: 0.3103 ± 0.0506 versus 0.5122 ± 0.0148; cytochrome C: 0.4194 ± 0.1116 versus 0.8127 ± 0.0166; LC3B: 0.5884 ± 0.0604 versus 1.3758 ± 0.0319; respectively, P < 0.01). Conclusions: HRS seems to be effective in attenuating IR injury in skeletal muscle via its antioxidant, anti-apoptosis, and anti-autophagy effect.

Three-fourths of cardiac arrest patients die before hospital discharge or experience significant neurological damage. Hydrogen-rich saline, a portable, easily administered, and safe means of delivering hydrogen gas, can exert organ-protective effects through regulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. We designed this study to investigate whether hydrogen-rich saline treatment could improve survival and neurological outcome after cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the mechanism responsible for this effect. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 8 minutes of cardiac arrest by asphyxia. Different doses of hydrogen-rich saline or normal saline were administered IV at 1 minute before cardiopulmonary resuscitation, followed by injections at 6 and 12 hours after restoration of spontaneous circulation, respectively. We assessed survival, neurological outcome, oxidative stress, inflammation biomarkers, and apoptosis. Results: Hydrogen-rich saline treatment dose dependently improved survival and neurological function after cardiac arrest/resuscitation. Moreover, hydrogen-rich saline treatment dose dependently ameliorated brain injury after cardiac arrest/resuscitation, which was characterized by the increase of survival neurons in hippocampus CA1, reduction of brain edema in cortex and hippocampus, preservation of blood-brain barrier integrity, as well as the decrease of serum S100β and neuron-specific enolase. Furthermore, we found that the beneficial effects of hydrogen-rich saline treatment were associated with decreased levels of oxidative products (8-iso-prostaglandin F2α and malondialdehyde) and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and high-mobility group box protein 1), as well as the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) in serum and brain tissues. In addition, hydrogen-rich saline treatment reduced caspase-3 activity in cortex and hippocampus after cardiac arrest/resuscitation. Conclusions: Hydrogen-rich saline treatment improved survival and neurological outcome after cardiac arrest/resuscitation in rats, which was partially mediated by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 500 ml of either H2-saline or placebo-saline, which was drop infused intravenously (DIV) daily for 5 days. The disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) was measured at baseline, immediately post infusion, and after 4 weeks. Therapeutic effects of H2-saline on joint inflammation were estimated by measuring serum biomarkers for RA, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). In the H2-infused group, average DAS28 decreased from 5.18 ± 1.16 to 4.02 ± 1.25 immediately post infusion and reached 3.74 ± 1.22 after 4 weeks. No significant decrease in DAS28 was observed in the placebo group throughout the study. IL-6 levels in the H2 group significantly decreased in 4 weeks by 37.3 ± 62.0% compared to baseline, whereas it increased by 33.6 ± 34.4% in the placebo group. TNFα levels did not change remarkably in the H2 or placebo groups in 4 weeks post-infusion compared to baseline. The relative ratio of 8-OHdG in the H2 group also significantly decreased by 4.7%. After 4 weeks, MMP3 was significantly reduced by 19.2% ± 24.6% in the H2 group, and increased by 16.9% ± 50.2% in the placebo group.

Brain is the most vulnerable to reactive species generated by a higher rate of oxygen consumption and glucose utilization compared to other organs. Electrochemically reduced water (ERW) was demonstrated to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) in several cell types. In the present study, the protective effect of ERW against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) was investigated in several rodent neuronal cell lines and primary cells. ERW was found to significantly suppress H2O2 (50-200 μM) induced PC12 and SFME cell deaths. ERW scavenged intracellular ROS and exhibited a protective effect against neuronal network damage caused by 200 μM H2O2 in N1E-115 cells. ERW significantly suppressed NO-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells despite the fact that it did not have the ability to scavenge intracellular NO. ERW significantly suppressed both glutamate induced Ca(2+) influx and the resulting cytotoxicity in primary cells. These results collectively demonstrated for the first time that ERW protects several types of neuronal cells by scavenging ROS because of the presence of hydrogen and platinum nanoparticles dissolved in ERW.

Accumulating evidence indicates that overproduction of oxidative stress is a key event in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. However, repeated intra-peritoneal or intrathecal injections of antioxidants are unsuitable for continuous use in therapy. Here we show a novel therapeutic method against neuropathic pain: drinking water containing molecular hydrogen (H2) as antioxidant. The effect of hydrogen on neuropathic pain was investigated using a partial sciatic nerve ligation model in mice. As indicators of neuropathic pain, temporal aspects of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were analysed for 3 weeks after ligation. Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were measured using the von Frey test and the plantar test, respectively. When mice were allowed to drink water containing hydrogen at a saturated level ad libitum after ligation, both allodynia and hyperalgesia were alleviated. These symptoms were also alleviated when hydrogen was administered only for the induction phase (from day 0 to 4 after ligation). When hydrogen was administered only for the maintenance phase (from day 4 to 21 after ligation), hyperalgesia but not allodynia was alleviated. Immunohistochemical staining for the oxidative stress marker, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, showed that hydrogen administration suppressed oxidative stress induced by ligation in the spinal cord and the dorsal root ganglion. In conclusion, oral administration of hydrogen water may be useful for alleviating neuropathic pain in a clinical setting.

However, its maximum dose is often limited by severe ototoxicity. Cisplatin ototoxicity may require the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the inner ear by activating enzymes specific to the cochlea. Molecular hydrogen was recently established as an antioxidant that selectively reduces ROS, and has been reported to protect the central nervous system, liver, kidney and cochlea from oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of molecular hydrogen to protect cochleae against cisplatin. We cultured mouse cochlear explants in medium containing various concentrations of cisplatin and examined the effects of hydrogen gas dissolved directly into the media. Following 48-h incubation, the presence of intact auditory hair cells was assayed by phalloidin staining. Cisplatin caused hair cell loss in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the addition of hydrogen gas significantly increased the numbers of remaining auditory hair cells. Additionally, hydroxyphenyl fluorescein (HPF) staining of the spiral ganglion showed that formation of hydroxyl radicals was successfully reduced in hydrogen-treated cochleae. These data suggest that molecular hydrogen can protect auditory tissues against cisplatin toxicity, thus providing an additional strategy to protect against drug-induced inner ear damage.

Sustained hepatocyte injury initiates an inflammatory response, thereby activating hepatic stellate cells, the principal fibrogenic cells in the liver. Reactive oxygen species are involved in liver injury and are a promising target for treating liver fibrosis. Hydrogen water is reported to have potential as a therapeutic tool for reactive oxygen species-associated disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hydrogen water on liver fibrogenesis and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were fed with hydrogen water or control water, and subjected to carbon tetrachloride, thioacetamide and bile duct ligation treatments to induce liver fibrosis. Hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells were isolated from mice and cultured with or without hydrogen to test the effects of hydrogen on reactive oxygen species-induced hepatocyte injuries or hepatic stellate cell activation. Results: Oral intake of hydrogen water significantly suppressed liver fibrogenesis in the carbon tetrachloride and thioacetamide models, but these effects were not seen in the bile duct ligation model. Treatment of isolated hepatocyte with 1 μg/mL antimycin A generated hydroxyl radicals. Culturing in the hydrogen-rich medium selectively suppressed the generation of hydroxyl radicals in hepatocytes and significantly suppressed hepatocyte death induced by antimycin A; however, it did not suppress hepatic stellate cell activation. Conclusion: We conclude that hydrogen water protects hepatocytes from injury by scavenging hydroxyl radicals and thereby suppresses liver fibrogenesis in mice.

We tested this hypothesis in guinea pigs with 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% H2 inhalation in air for 5h a day after noise exposure, for five consecutive days. All animals underwent measurements for auditory brainstem response after the noise exposure; the results revealed that there was a better improvement in the threshold shift for the 1.0% and 1.5% H2-treated groups than the non-treated group. Furthermore, outer hair cell (OHC) loss was examined 7 days after noise exposure.

The pathological change in liver tissue was observed with HE staining. The number of hepatic neutrophils was counted with a hematocytometer. Serum levels of AST and ALT were determined with full-automatic biochemical analyzer. Contents of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in liver tissue were determined with ELISA. Absorbance value of malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver tissue was detected and quantified with spectrophotometer. Data were processed with analysis of variance of repeated measurement and LSD-t test. At PSH 48, moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells and hepatic hyperemia were observed in rats of group HS as compared with group RS. At PSH 12, 24, and 48, the number of neutrophils in group HS was respectively (25.3 ± 1.8)×10(5), (19.6 ± 0.6)×10(5), and (14.1 ± 3.2)×10(5) cells per mililitre, and they were significantly lower than those in group RS \[(31.9 ± 2.0)×10(5), (30.9 ± 2.2)×10(5), and (23.8 ± 3.0)×10(5) cells per mililitre, with t values respectively 5.6, 7.6, and 8.7, P values below 0.05\].

Hydrogen has been deemed as a novel antioxidant. We investigated whether molecular hydrogen could act as an antiastrogliosis agent during SCI and oxidative injury in experimental rats and cultured astrocytes. Methods: Hydrogen-rich saline (HS, 8 mL/kg, i.p.) was injected every 12 h after SCI in rats. The expression of STAT3, p-STAT3, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); the release of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α; and astrogliosis, along with the BBB score, were evaluated. Culturing astrocytes with hydrogen-rich medium, the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), astrogliosis, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines were assessed after H2O2-induced injury. Results: In the HS group, the expression of STAT3, p-STAT3, and GFAP and the proinflammatory cytokines were decreased in local spinal cord on postoperation day (POD) 3; on PODs 7 and 14, reactive astrogliosis was suppressed, and the locomotor function was also improved. Furthermore, hydrogen-rich medium attenuated the intracellular production of ROS (especially HO•), astrogliosis, and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in astrocytes 12 h after H2O2-induced injury. Conclusions: Molecular hydrogen could suppress reactive astrogliosis after contusive SCI and reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines produced by active astrocytes related to oxidative injury. Thus, molecular hydrogen is potential to be a neuroprotective agent.

Mice in sham+H2 and sepsis+H2 groups received 2% H2 inhalation for 1 h at 1 h and 6 h after sham operation or CLP operation respectively. The changes of neurological function and neuronal damage in hippocampal CA1 region were observed at 24 h post-operation. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α) in sera and hippocampus were detected at 24 h post-operation. The changes of cognitive function were observed by Y-maze test and fear conditional test at days 3 to 14 post-operation. Compared with sham group, the neurological function significantly declined and neurons in hippocampal CA1 region were significantly damaged; the activities of SOD and CAT markedly decreased while the levels of MDA and 8-iso-PGF2α markedly increased in sera and hippocampus; the time in new zone and the percentage of freezing time dramatically decreased at days 3 to 14 post-operation in sepsis group (P < 0.05) .

Moreover, sepsis survivors also accompany long-term cognitive dysfunction, while the ultimate causes and effective therapeutic strategies of brain injury in sepsis are still not fully clear. We designed this study to investigate the effects of 2% hydrogen gas (H2) on brain injury in a mouse model of sepsis. Male ICR mice were underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation. 2% H2 was inhaled for 60min beginning at both 1 and 6h after sham or CLP operation, respectively. H2 concentration in arterial blood, venous blood and brain tissue was detected after H2 inhalation separately. The survival rate was observed and recorded within 7 days after sham or CLP operation. The histopathologic changes and neuronal apoptosis were observed in hippocampus by Nissl staining and TUNEL assay. The permeability of brain-blood barrier (BBB), brain water content, inflammatory cytokines, activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) and oxidative products (MDA and 8-iso-PGF2α) in serum and hippocampus were detected at 24h after sham or CLP operation. The expressions of nucleus and total nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and cytoplasmic heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) in hippocampus were measured at 24h after sham or CLP operation. We assessed their cognitive function via Y-maze and Fear Conditioning test on day 3, 5, 7 and 14 after operation. H2 treatment markedly improved the survival rate and cognitive dysfunction of septic mice. CLP mice showed obvious brain injury characterized by aggravated pathological damage, BBB disruption and brain edema at 24h after CLP operation, which was markedly alleviated by 2% H2 treatment. Furthermore, we found that the beneficial effects of H2 on brain injury in septic mice were linked to the decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative products and the increased activities of antioxidant enzymes in serum and hippocampus. In addition, 2% H2 inhalation promoted the expression and transposition of Nrf2 and the expression of HO-1 to mitigate brain injury in sepsis.

Hydrogen treatment was recently associated with down-regulation of the expression of HMGB1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines during sepsis and myocardial IRI, but it is not known whether hydrogen has an effect on HMGB1 in liver IRI. Hydrogen enriched saline treatment significantly attenuated the severity of liver injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion. The treatment group showed reduced serum ALT activity and markers of lipid peroxidation and post ischemia reperfusion histological changes were reduced. Hydrogen enriched saline treatment inhibited HMGB1 expression and release, reflecting a reduced local and systemic inflammatory response to hepatic ischemia reperfusion. A rat model of 60 minutes 70% partial liver ischemia reperfusion injury was used. hydrogen enriched saline (2.5, 5 or 10 ml/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 10 minutes before hepatic reperfusion. Liver injury was assessed by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme levels and histological changes. We also measured malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxynonenal (HNE) and 8-hydroxy-guanosine (8-OH-G) levels as markers of the peroxidation injury induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha and IL-6, and high mobility group box B1 protein (HMGB1) were measured as markers of post ischemia-reperfusion inflammation.

Rat diffuse axonal injury was induced by an experimental facility, which was developed to make the rat head spin 90 degrees at the moment to cause shearing injury. Hydrogen gas of high purity was injected intraperitoneally into rats of DAI model twice per day (10mL/kg).

Recently, H2 has been reported to prevent a variety of diseases associated with oxidative stress in model systems and in humans. Here, we studied the effects of H2 on rat fetal hippocampal damage caused by ischemia and reperfusion (IR) on day 16 of pregnancy with the transient occlusion of the bilateral utero-ovarian arteries. Starting 2 days before the operation, we provided the mothers with hydrogen-saturated water ad libitum until vaginal delivery. We observed a significant increase in the concentration of H2 in the placenta after the oral administration of hydrogen-saturated water to the mothers, with less placental oxidative damage after IR in the presence of H2. Neonatal growth retardation was observed in the IR group, which was alleviated by the H2 administration. We analyzed the neuronal cell damage in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus at day 7 after birth by immunohistochemical analysis of the 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2׳-deoxyguanosine- and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified proteins. Both oxidative stress markers were significantly increased in the IR group, which was again ameliorated by the H2 intake. Last, 8-week-old rats were subjected to a Morris water maze test. Maternal H2 administration improved the reference memory of the offspring to the sham level after IR injury during pregnancy. Overall, the present results support the idea that maternal H2 intake helps prevent the hippocampal impairment of offspring induced by IR during pregnancy.

One of the major events during I/R injury is the generation of cytotoxic oxygen radicals. Recently, hydrogen gas has been reported to have antioxidant properties and protective effects against organ dysfunction induced by I/R injury. The aim of this study is to investigate effects of hydrogen on porcine liver reperfusion injury. Materials and Methods Six outbred pigs weighing 20 kg were used for the experiment. Under general anesthesia, the venous bypass between the left femoral vein and the splenic vein to the left jugular vein was made using a centrifugal pump. Then, we used a total vascular exclusion clamp (all in- and out-flow to the liver was clamped) for 60 minutes. Hydrogen (5 ppm) saturated with lactate Ringer's solution was prepared. This solution was infused through the portal vein just before reperfusion (hydrogen group). Results Aspartate aminotransferase levels in the control versus hydrogen group in 30, 60, and 120 minutes after reperfusion were 1560.3, 1925.3, and 2342.5 versus 175.3, 200.7, and 661.00 IU/L, respectively.

This study examined proinflammatory events and metabolic profiles in lung grafts on EVLP and tested whether preconditioning lung grafts with inhaled hydrogen, a potent, cytoprotective gaseous signaling molecule, would alter the lungs' response to EVLP. Methods: Rat heart-lung blocks were mounted on an acellular normothermic EVLP system for 4 hr and ventilated with air or air supplemented with 2% hydrogen. Arterial and airway pressures were monitored continuously; perfusate was sampled hourly to examine oxygenation. After EVLP, the lung grafts were transplanted orthotopically into syngeneic rats, and lung function was examined. Results: Placing lung grafts on EVLP resulted in significant upregulation of the messenger RNAs for several proinflammatory cytokines, higher glucose consumption, and increased lactate production. Hydrogen administration attenuated proinflammatory changes during EVLP through upregulation of the heme oxygenase-1. Hydrogen administration also promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and significantly decreased lactate production. Additionally, in the hydrogen-treated lungs, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 was significantly attenuated during EVLP. These effects were maintained throughout EVLP and led to better posttransplant lung graft function in the recipients of hydrogen-treated lungs. Conclusions: Lung grafts on EVLP exhibited prominent proinflammatory changes and compromised metabolic profiles.

PURPOSE: To examine the effects of one-week oral and topical H2 administration on markers of inflammation, functional recovery and pain intensity in competitive male athletes after acute MTS. METHODS: During the 2013 competitive season (from March to May) participants (12 professional athletes) were recruited and examined by a certified sports medicine specialist in the first 24 hours after a MTS was sustained. The subjects were allocated in a double-blind design to two randomly assigned trials: control group (CON) received a traditional treatment protocol after the soft-tissue injury (first 48 h: rest, ice packs for 20 min every 2 h, compression with elastic bandage, elevation of the injured area above the level of the heart at all possible times; next 5 days: passive stretching 3 times per day for 90 sec, isometric strength exercise with 3 sets with 15 reps, 30 min of pain-free weight-bearing exercise); experimental group (HYD) followed the above procedures with additional administration of oral H2 tablets (2 g/day) and topical hydrogen-rich packs (6 times per day for 20 min).

The main aim of this pilot study was to examine the effects of 2-week administration of hydrogen on the biochemical markers of inflammation and functional recovery in male professional athletes after acute soft tissue injury. Method: During the 2013 season (from March to May), 36 professional athletes were recruited as participants and examined by a certified sports medicine specialist in the first 24 hours after an injury was sustained. Subjects were allocated to 3 randomly assigned trials in a single-blind design. Those in the control group received a traditional treatment protocol for soft tissue injury. Subjects in the first experimental group followed the same procedures as the control group but with additional administration throughout the study of oral hydrogen-rich tablets (2 g per day).

Results: Oral and topical hydrogen intervention was found to augment plasma viscosity decrease as compared with the control group (P = 0.04). Differences were found for range-of-motion recovery between the 3 groups; oral and topical hydrogen intervention resulted in a faster return to normal joint range of motion for both flexion and extension of the injured limb as compared with the control intervention (P < 0.05). Conclusion: These preliminary results support the hypothesis that the addition of hydrogen to traditional treatment protocols is potentially effective in the treatment of soft tissue injuries in male professional athletes.

Hydrogen-rich saline (HRS), a well-known ROS scavenger, has been shown to possess therapeutic benefit on AP in many animal experiments. Recent findings have indicated that the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, an intracellular multiprotein complex required for the maturation of interleukin- (IL-) 1β, may probably be a potential target of HRS in the treatment of AP. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and meanwhile assessed the degree of oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades, as well as the histological alterations in mice suffering from cerulein-induced AP after the treatment of HRS. The results showed that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in AP mice was substantially inhibited following the administration of HRS, which was paralleled with the decreased NF-κB activity and cytokines production, attenuated oxidative stress and the amelioration of pancreatic tissue damage. In conclusion, our study has, for the first time, revealed that inhibition of the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome probably contributed to the therapeutic potential of HRS in AP.",Positive,Mouse,Pancreas,Pancreatitis,Inflammation,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

A third reactive oxygen species (ROS), H2O2, is known to have both beneficial and detrimental effects on the vasculature. Nonetheless, the influence of the hydroxyl radical, a byproduct of H2O2 decay, is unclear, and there is no direct evidence that the hydroxyl radical impairs endothelial function in conduit arteries. Molecular hydrogen (H2) neutralizes detrimental ROS, especially the hydroxyl radical. Objectives: To assess the influence of the hydroxyl radical on the endothelium and to confirm that a gaseous antioxidant, H2, can be a useful modulator of blood vessel function. Methods: The efficacy of water containing a high concentration of H2 was tested by measuring flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery (BA). The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: the high-H2 group, who drank high-H2 water containing 7 ppm H2 (3.5 mg H2 in 500 mL water); and the placebo group. Endothelial function was evaluated by measuring the FMD of the BA. After measurement of diameter of the BA and FMD at baseline, volunteers drank the high-H2 water or placebo water immediately and with a 30-minute interval; FMD was compared to baseline. Results: FMD increased in the high-H2 group (eight males; eight females) from 6.80%±1.96% to 7.64%±1.68% (mean ± standard deviation) and decreased from 8.07%±2.41% to 6.87%±2.94% in the placebo group (ten males; eight females). The ratio to the baseline in the changes of FMD showed significant improvement (P<0.05) in the high-H2 group compared to the placebo group. Conclusion: H2 may protect the vasculature from shear stress-derived detrimental ROS, such as the hydroxyl radical, by maintaining the nitric oxide-mediated vasomotor response.

Ischemic reperfusion was induced in Lewis rats by occlusion of the supramesenteric artery and vein for 90 min. Experimental protocols were divided into four groups: sham operation group, no luminal injection (control) group, luminal injection of 5% glucose saline (GS) solution group, and luminal injection of hydrogen-rich GS (HRGS) group. Two milliliters of experimental solution was locally injected into the lumen of the intestine before declamping of vessels. Oxidative stress markers, proinflammatory cytokines, apoptosis in the crypt cells, and morphologic changes of the intestine were assessed.

Methods: We tested the hypothesis that after optic nerve crush (ONC), retinal ganglion cell (RGC) could be protected by H₂. Rats in different groups received saline or hydrogen-rich saline every day for 14 days after ONC. Retinas from animals in each group underwent measurements of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, cholera toxin beta (CTB) tracing, gamma synuclein staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining 2 weeks post operation. Flash visual evoked potentials (FVEP) and pupillary light reflex (PLR) were then tested to evaluate the function of optic nerve. The malondialdehyde (MDA) level in retina was evaluated. Results: H&E, gamma synuclein staining and CTB tracing showed that the survival rate of RGCs in hydrogen saline-treated group was significantly higher than that in saline-treated group. Apoptosis of RGCs assessed by TUNEL staining were less observed in hydrogen saline-treated group. The MDA level in retina of H₂ group was much lower than that in placebo group. Furthermore, animals treated with hydrogen saline showed better function of optic nerve in assessments of FVEP and PLR. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that H₂ protects RGCs and helps preserve the visual function after ONC and had a neuroprotective effect in a rat model subjected to ONC.

We demonstrated the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects and functional mechanisms of hydrogen-rich saline (HS), a novel antioxidant, on an experimental model of rats after a partial hepatectomy (PH). Methods The rats underwent a 90% hepatectomy. HS was given intraperitoneally after the operation and every 8 hours after. Results HS markedly improved the survival rate of two experimental groups after the massive hepatectomy and inhibited increases in serum levels of TBIL, DBIL, ALT and AST. The histopathological analysis demonstrated that HS attenuated inflammatory changes in the liver. HS administration markedly lowered the massive hepatectomy induced elevation of the serum hyaluronic acid (HA) concentrations. HS inhibited the formation of one of the markers of oxidative damage, malondialdehyde (MDA), and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver tissue. In the HS-treated group, increases in inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6 and HMGB-1, were inhibited in the liver tissue. The NF-κB p65 staining revealed that HS inhibited the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB).

Eight patients on regular HD treatment were studied. Two HD sessions were performed in a cross-over design trial using standard and hydrogen-enriched solutions (mean of 50 p.p.b. H2; H2-HD). Blood samples were obtained from the inlet and outlet of the dialyzer during HD to determine changes in plasma levels of glutathione, hydrogen peroxide, and albumin redox state as a marker of OS. Comparison of inlet and outlet blood revealed significant decreases in total glutathione and reduced glutathione, as well as significant increases in hydrogen peroxide in both HD treatments. However, the mean proportion of reversibly oxidized albumin in outlet serum was significantly lower than that in inlet serum following the H2-HD session, whereas no significant changes were found in the standard solution session, suggesting that 'intra-dialyzer' OS is reduced by H2 -HD.

Hydrogen has been identified as a novel antioxidant which could selectively scavenge hydroxyl radicals. We explore whether intake of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) can protect Wistar rats from CPF-induced neurotoxicity. Rats were gavaged daily with 6.75mg/kg body weight (1/20 LD50) of CPF and given HRW by oral intake. Nissl staining and electron microscopy results indicated that HRW intake had protective effects on the CPF-induced damage of hippocampal neurons and neuronal mitochondria. Immunostaining results showed that the increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in astrocytes induced by CPF exposure can be ameliorated by HRW intake. Moreover, HRW intake also attenuated CPF-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by enhanced level of MDA, accompanied by an increase in GSH level and SOD and CAT activity. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity tests showed significant decrease in brain AChE activity after CPF exposure, and this effect can be ameliorated by HRW intake. An in vitro study demonstrated that AChE activity was more intense in HRW than in normal water with or without chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO), the metabolically-activated form of CPF. These observations suggest that HRW intake can protect rats from CPF-induced neurotoxicity, and the protective effects of hydrogen may be mediated by regulating the oxidant and antioxidant status of rats. Furthermore, this work defines a novel mechanism of biological activity of hydrogen by directly increasing the AChE activity.

Scavenging free radicals and/or enhancing endogenous antioxidative defense systems may be beneficial for the impediment of myocardial ischemic injury. Hydrogen (H2) gas, as a water‑ and lipid‑soluble small molecule, is not only able to selectively eliminate hydroxyl (·OH) free radicals, but also to enhance endogenous antioxidative defense systems in rat lungs and arabidopsis plants. However, thus far, it has remained elusive whether H2 gas protects cardiomyocytes through enhancement of endogenous antioxidative defense systems. In the present study, the cardioprotective effect of H2 gas against ischemic or hypoxic injury was investigated, along with the underlying molecular mechanisms. H9c2 cardiomyoblasts (H9c2 cells) were treated in vitro with a chemical hypoxia inducer, cobalt chloride (CoCl2), to imitate hypoxia, or by serum and glucose deprivation (SGD) to imitate ischemia. Cell viability and intracellular ·OH free radicals were assessed. The role of an endogenous antioxidative defense system, the NF‑E2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO‑1) signaling pathway, was evaluated. The findings revealed that treatment with CoCl2 or SGD markedly reduced cell viability in H9c2 cells. H2 gas‑rich medium protected against cell injury induced by SGD, but not that induced by CoCl2. When the cells were exposed to SGD, levels of intracellular ·OH free radicals were markedly increased; this was mitigated by H2 gas‑rich medium. Exposure of the cells to SGD also resulted in significant increases in HO‑1 expression and nuclear Nrf2 levels, and the HO‑1 inhibitor ZnPP IX and the Nrf2 inhibitor brusatol aggravated SGD‑induced cellular injury. H2 gas‑rich medium enhanced SGD‑induced upregulation of HO‑1 and Nrf2, and the HO‑1 or Nrf2 inhibition partially suppressed H2 gas‑induced cardioprotection. Furthermore, following genetic silencing of Nrf2 by RNA interference, the effects of H2 gas on the induction of HO‑1 and cardioprotection were markedly reduced. In conclusion, H2 gas protected cardiomyocytes from ischemia‑induced myocardial injury through elimination of ·OH free radicals and also through activation of the Nrf2/HO‑1 signaling pathway.",Positive,Cell Culture,Heart,Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction),Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) Injury,Medium (Dissolved),Neutral,Culture Media,,,China

We attempted to identify the dose-response relationship of hydrogen in alkaline electrolyzed drinking water through the aspirin induced gastric injury model. In this study, hydrogen-rich alkaline water was obtained by adding H2 to electrolyzed water at one atmosphere pressure. After 2 weeks of drinking, we detected the gastric mucosal damage together with MPO, MDA and 8-OHdG in rat aspirin induced gastric injury model. Hydrogen-dose dependent inhibition was observed in stomach mucosal. Under pH 8.5, 0.07, 0.22 and 0.84 ppm hydrogen exhibited a high correlation with inhibitory effects showed by erosion area, MPO activity and MDA content in the stomach. Gastric histology also demonstrated the inhibition of damage by hydrogen-rich alkaline water. However, 8-OHdG level in serum did not have significant hydrogen-dose dependent effect. pH 9.5 showed higher but not significant inhibitory response compared with pH 8.5. Hydrogen is effective in relieving the gastric injury induced by aspirin-HCl, and the inhibitory effect is dose-dependent. The reason behind this may be that hydrogen-rich water directly interacted with the target tissue, while the hydrogen concentration in blood was buffered by liver glycogen, evoking a suppressed dose-response effect.

Methods: Acute peritonitis was induced by three methods including intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), rats' feces or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation. For each model, male Sprague Dawley rats were used and distributed into saline control group, HRW control group, saline plus model group, and HRW plus model group. Saline or HRW (3 ml per rat) was orally administered by gavage for 7 days beforehand and 3 days after modeling. The efficacy was tested by detecting concentrations of white blood cells (WBCs), plasma endotoxin, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The activities of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and glutathione (GSH) in visceral peritoneum tissues were also evaluated. Meanwhile, histopathology examination of visceral peritoneum was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression and location of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) in the visceral peritoneum were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: Three models showed the same result that hydrogen-rich water had an efficient protective effect on acute peritonitis. HRW could significantly lower the levels of WBCs, plasma endotoxin and cytokines, enhance GSH activity and reduce MPO and MDA activities in the peritoneum tissue when compared with that of groups with only saline treated. Simultaneously, we found that HRW could also decrease the NF-κB expression in the peritoneum tissues. Conclusion: Hydrogen-rich water could alleviate the severity of acute peritonitis, and it might perform this function by its anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-bacterial effects and reducing NF-κB expression in the peritoneum tissues.

Forty male rats were allocated into four groups: normal control group, HRW group, aspirin group, and HRW plus aspirin group. The protective efficacy was tested by determining the gastric mucosal damage score. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin (IL)-06 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in gastric tissues were evaluated. The serum levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were also detected. Histopathology of gastric tissues and localization of Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) were detected using hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Pretreatment with HRW obviously reduced aspirin-induced gastric damage scores (4.04 ± 0.492 vs 2.10 ± 0.437, P < 0.05). The oxidative stress levels of MDA and MPO in the gastric tissues increased significantly in the aspirin-treated group compared with the HRW group (2.43 ± 0.145 vs 1.79 ± 0.116 nmol/mg prot, P < 0.05 and 2.53 ± 0.238 vs 1.40 ± 0.208 U/g tissue, P < 0.05, respectively).

It is demonstrated that inflammation is associated with spinal NMDAR-containing nociceptive neurons activation and the maintenance of opioid induced pain hypersensitivity. However, whether and how hydrogen-rich saline, as an effective anti-inflammatory drug, could prevent hyperalgesia through affecting peripheral sensitization caused by NMDAR activation remains to be explored. Methods: To test these effects, hydrogen-rich saline (2.5, 5 or 10 ml/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally after remifentanil infusion, NMDAR antagonist MK-801 or GSK-3β inhibitor TDZD-8 was administrated intravenously before remifentanil infusion in rats. We examined time course of hydrogen concentration in blood after hydrogen-rich saline administration. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated by measuring PWT and PWL for 48 post-infusion hours, respectively. Western blotting and real-time qPCR assay were applied to analyze the NR1 membrane trafficking, GSK-3β expression and activity in DRG. Inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) expressions in DRG were also analyzed. Results: We found that NR1 membrane trafficking in DRG increased, possibly due to GSK-3β activation after remifentanil infusion. We also discovered that hydrogen-rich saline not 2.5 ml/kg but 5 and 10 ml/kg could dose-dependently attenuate mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia without affecting baseline nociceptive threshold, reduce expressions of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and decrease NR1 trafficking mediated by GSK-3β, and minimal effective concentration was observed to be higher than 10 μmol/L, namely peak concentration in arterial blood after administration of HRS 2.5 ml/kg without any influence on hyperalgesia. Conclusion: Our results indicated that antihyperalgesic effect of hydrogen-rich saline might depend predominantly on its ability to reverse NR1 trafficking via inhibition of GSK-3β activity in DRG in a dose-dependent manner.",Positive,Rat,Brain,Neuroprotection,Drug Toxicity (Remifentanil),Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

MnSOD nitration and inactivation caused by generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of NMDA receptors are involved in the induction and maintenance of central neuropathic pain. Hydrogen which selectively removes superoxide has gained much attention in recent years. In this study, we investigated antinociceptive effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) on remifentanil-induced postsurgical hyperalgesia in a rat model of incisional pain. HRS was injected intraperitoneally 10min before remifentanil infusion (1μg·kg(-1)·min(-1)for 60min). A selective NR2B antagonist Ro25-6981 was used to investigate whether antihypernociception of HRS is associated with NMDAR. Nociception was evaluated by the paw withdrawal mechanical threshold and thermal latency respectively. Then we assessed MnSOD, NR2A and NR2B in spinal cord dorsal horn via Western blot and immunohistochemistry after nociceptive tests. Here, we found that the analgesic effect of remifentanil was followed by long-term hyperalgesia lasting at least postoperative 7 days, which was accompanied with increase in NR2B expression and trafficking from cytoplasm to surface and MnSOD nitration in dorsal horn. Pretreatment with HRS (10ml/kg) significantly attenuated mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, blocked NR2B trafficking and MnSOD nitration in dorsal horn after remifentanil infusion. Ro25-6981 not 5 μg but 10 and 50 μg dosage-dependently attenuated hyperalgesia, and inhibited MnSOD nitration. Hyperalgesia and MnSOD nitration were attenuated after the combination of HRS (2.5ml/kg) and Ro25-6981(5μg).

However, it is not clear whether hydrogen can prolong longevity based on these effects. Therefore, we studied and explored the antiaging potential of exogenous hydrogen and its ability to extend longevity using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as an animal model. Our results showed that the lifespans of the N2, sod-3 and sod-5 mutant strains were extended by approximately 22.7%, 9.5%, and 8.7%, respectively, after hydrogen treatment, but hydrogen had no effect on the lifespans of the daf-2 and daf-16 mutant strains. Meanwhile, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hydrogen treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group. At the transcript level, the expression of age-1 and let-363 was obviously decreased, while the expression of ins-18 was increased at the same time point (14 d). Compared with the control group, paraquat (PQ) could reduce the lifespan of the N2 and sod-5 mutant strains. Importantly, the longevity of these mutant strains recovered to normal levels when the animals were treated with exogenous hydrogen. According to these results, the lifespan of C. elegans is closely related to oxidative stress and can be significantly prolonged by reducing oxidative stress damage. Taken together, our data showed that hydrogen is a valuable antioxidant that can significantly reduce the body’s ROS levels and extend the lifespan of C. elegans.

Methods: RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated by LPS (1 μg/mL) with presence or absence of different concentrations of H2. Cell viability and injury were tested by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, respectively. The cell culture supernatants were collected to measure inflammatory cytokines [TNF-α, IL-1β, HMGB1 (high mobility group box-1) and IL-10] at different time points. Moreover, HO-1 protein expression and activity were tested at different time points. In addition, to further identify the role of HO-1 in this process, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP)-IX, an HO-1 inhibitor, was used. Results: H2 treatment had no significant influence on cell viability and injury in normally cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. Moreover, H₂ treatment dose-dependently attenuated the increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, HMGB1), but further increased the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after LPS stimulation. Furthermore, H₂ treatment could also dose-dependently increase the HO-1 protein expression and activity at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h in LPS-activated macrophages. In addition, blockade of HO-1 activity with ZnPP-IX partly reversed the anti-inflammatory effect of H₂ in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Conclusions: Molecular hydrogen exerts a regulating role in the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and this effect is at least partly mediated by HO-1 expression and activation.

In addition, hydrogen-rich saline also suppressed the expression of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the spinal cord by 7 days post-chronic constriction injury (p<0.01, p<0.01, respectively), but had no effect on P2X4R (p>0.05), an ATP receptor. Conclusion: Intrathecal injection of hydrogen-rich saline can decrease oxidative stress and the expression of p38MAPK and BDNF that may contribute to the elevated threshold of neuropathic pain in rat CCI model.

Orally administered lactulose, a potent H2 inducer, is digested by colon microflora and significantly increases H2 production, indicating its potential anti-inflammatory action. Objective: To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of lactulose on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Methods: Mice were randomly assigned into seven groups, receiving regular distilled water, H2-rich saline (peritoneal injection), DSS, oral lactulose (0.1, 0.15, 0.2 ml/10 g, respectively), and lactulose (0.2 ml/10 g) + oral antibiotics. The mouse model of human ulcerative colitis was established by supplying mice with water containing DSS. The H2 breath test was used to determine the exhaled H2 concentration. Body weight, colitis score, colon length, pathological features and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), maleic dialdehyde (MDA) and marrow peroxidase (MPO) levels in colon lesions were evaluated. Results: After 7 days, DSS-induced loss of body weight, increase of colitis score, shortening of colon length, pathological changes and elevated levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, MDA, and MPO in colon lesions, were significantly suppressed by oral lactulose administration and intraperitoneally injected H2-rich saline. Ingestion of antibiotics significantly compromised the anti-inflammatory effects of lactulose. The H2 breath test showed that lactulose administration significantly induced hydrogen production and that antibiotics administration could inhibit H2 production. Conclusion: Lactulose can prevent the development of DSS-induced colitis and alleviate oxidative stress in the colon, as measured by MDA and MPO, probably by increasing endogenous H2 production.

The purpose of the present study was to further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Daily injection of a hydrogen-rich saline solution (HRSS) in rats was employed to study the effect of hydrogen on balloon injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia and the neointima/media ratio was assessed. HRSS significantly decreased the neointima area and neointima/media ratio in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro effects of hydrogen on fetal bovine serum (FBS)-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation were also investigated. Hydrogen-rich medium (HRM) inhibited rat VSMC proliferation and migration induced by 10% FBS. FBS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and activation of intracellular Ras, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Akt were significantly inhibited by HRM. In addition, HRM blocked FBS-induced progression from the G0/G1 to the S-phase and increased the apoptosis rate of VSMCs. These results showed that hydrogen-rich saline was able to attenuate FBS-induced VSMC proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia by inhibiting ROS production and inactivating the Ras-ERK1/2-MEK1/2 and Akt pathways.

We investigated the effect of hydrogen on erectile dysfunction in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Materials and methods: Diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley® rats by a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin. Diabetic rats were then randomized to a diabetes mellitus group and to a diabetic group that received hydrogen saline. The latter 8 rats were fed saturated hydrogen saline (5 ml/kg per day) by intragastric administration for 8 weeks. At the end of week 8 erectile function was assessed by measuring the increase in intracavernous pressure after cavernous nerve electrostimulation. We measured nitric oxide synthase activity, and malondialdehyde, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, and nitrite and nitrate in the corpus cavernosum. eNOS protein immunolocalization in cavernous tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. eNOS, Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression was determined by Western blot. We determined eNOS, Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiological mechanism of erectile dysfunction. Maximum intracavernous pressure in diabetic rats decreased significantly compared to controls and increased significantly compared to untreated diabetic rats after hydrogen-rich saline treatment. Decreased nitric oxide synthase activity, nitrite and nitrate, and eNOS expression as well as increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and malondialdehyde were found in the diabetic group compared to controls. Hydrogen-rich saline improved nitric oxide synthase activity, and malondialdehyde, nitrite and nitrate, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels in the diabetic rat corpus cavernosum. Decreased eNOS in diabetic rats was ameliorated by hydrogen-rich saline. Also, apoptosis in the diabetic rat corpus cavernosum was significantly enhanced compared with controls. Hydrogen-rich saline therapy may decrease apoptosis in cavernous tissues and it ameliorated erectile dysfunction in diabetic rats by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis.

Previous studies on a variety of organs indicate that hydrogen-rich saline not only has considerable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but also suppresses oxidative stress-induced injury. In the present study, we assessed the effects of hydrogen-rich saline on neurovascular dysfunction and oxidative stress in an animal model (rat) of DR. Materials and methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) were injected intraperitoneally with 5 ml/kg hydrogen-saturated (experimental) or plain (control) saline daily for one month. Visual function and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity were evaluated by electroretinography (ERG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA)-fluorescence, respectively. Histological changes in the inner retina were assessed by light microscopy. Biomarkers of oxidative stress, including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), and antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione transferase, were evaluated by ELISA.

Recently, it was demonstrated that hydrogen gas, as a novel antioxidant, could selectively reduce hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite anion to exert potent therapeutic antioxidant activity. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of hydrogen water (HW) consumption on ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis. Experimental approach: Ovariectomized rats were fed with HW (1.3 ± 0.2 mg·L⁻¹) for 3 months. Then, blood was collected and femur and vertebrae were removed for evaluation of the effect of HW on bone. Key results: HW consumption in ovariectomized rats had no significant effect on oestrogen production, but prevented the reduction of bone mass including bone mineral content and bone mineral density in femur and vertebrae, and preserved mechanical strength including ultimate load, stiffness, and energy, and bone structure including trabecular bone volume fraction, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness in femur, and preserved mechanical strength including ultimate load and stiffness, and bone structure including trabecular bone volume fraction and trabecular number in vertebrae. In addition, treatment with HW abated oxidative stress and suppressed IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA expressions in femur of ovariectomized rats; treatment with HW increased femur endothelial NOS activity and enhanced circulating NO level in ovariectomized rats. Conclusions and implications: HW consumption prevents osteopenia in ovariectomized rats possibly through the ablation of oxidative stress induced by oestrogen withdrawal.

Molecular hydrogen has been documented as a novel antioxidant to treat various reactive oxygen species-related diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of hydrogen on UC using a rat model. Materials and methods: UC in rats was induced with intracolonically administrated acetic acid. Hydrogen was supplied through intraperitoneal injection of 10 or 20 mL/kg hydrogen-rich saline. The hydrogen treatment was performed once every 2 d and lasted 2 wk. The stool consistency and weight loss were used to evaluate UC development. Colonic mucosal damage at the end of the experiment was scored using the macroscopic and microscopic observations. Vascular endothelial growth factor expression in the colonic mucosa was determined using immunohistochemistry. Results: The administration of acetic acid induced acute rat UC, as indicated by diarrhea, weight loss, and colonic mucosal damage. Treatment with hydrogen-rich saline reduced the weight loss and diarrhea and alleviated the colonic mucosal damage in the UC rats. In addition, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in the UC rats increased and could be inhibited by hydrogen treatment. Conclusions: Antioxidative hydrogen-rich saline effectively protected the rats from UC, which might be, at least in part, because of inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor.

Excessive fatty acid uptake mediated by fatty acid translocase CD36 plays an important role in hepatic steatosis. Molecular hydrogen has been shown to attenuate oxidative stress and improve lipid, glucose and energy metabolism in patients and animal models of hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Methods: Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were exposed to palmitate-BSA complex after treatment with or without hydrogen for 24 h. The fatty acid uptake was measured by using spectrofluorometry and the lipid content was detected by Oil Red O staining. JNK phosphorylation and CD36 expression were analyzed by Western blot and real-time PCR analyses. Results: Pretreatment with hydrogen reduced fatty acid uptake and lipid accumulation after palmitate overload in HepG2 cells, which was associated with inhibition of JNK activation. Hydrogen treatment did not alter CD36 mRNA expression but reduced CD36 protein expression. Conclusion: Hydrogen inhibits fatty acid uptake and lipid accumulation through the downregulation of CD36 at the protein level in hepatic cultured cells, providing insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the hydrogen effects in vivo on lipid metabolism disorders.

Treatment with H2 reduced mRNA levels of osteoclast-specific markers including tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, calcitonin receptor, cathepsin K, metalloproteinase-9, carbonic anhydrase typeII, and vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase. Treatment with H2 decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, suppressed NADPH oxidase activity, down-regulated Rac1 activity and Nox1 expression, reduced mitochondrial ROS formation, and enhanced nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 nuclear translocation and heme oxygenase-1 activity. In addition, treatment with H2 suppressed RANKL-induced expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 and c-Fos. Furthermore, treatment with H2 suppressed NF-κB activation and reduced phosphorylation of p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, and protein kinases B (AKT) stimulated with RANKL. In conclusion, hydrogen molecules prevented RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation associated with inhibition of reactive oxygen species formation and inactivation of NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT pathways.",Positive,Cell Culture,Bone,Surgery/Transplantation,Bone Loss,Medium (Dissolved),Neutral,Culture Media,,,China

Rats were injected with Fe-NTA solution (7.5mg Fe/kg body weight) intraperitoneally to induce renal injury and simultaneously treated with HW (1.3 ± 0.2mg/l). We found that consumption with HW ameliorated Fe-NTA-induced renal injuries including suppressing elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen and inhibited early tumor promotional events including decreasing ornithine decarboxylase activity and incorporation of [3H]thymidine into renal DNA. Consumption with HW suppressed Fe-NTA-induced oxidative stress through decreasing formation of lipid peroxidation and peroxynitrite and activities of NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase, increasing activity of catalase, and restoring mitochondrial function in kidneys. Consumption with HW suppressed Fe-NTA-induced inflammation marked by reduced NF-κB, IL-6, and MCP-1 expression and macrophage accumulating in kidneys. In addition, consumption with HW suppressed VEGF expression, STAT3 phosphorylation and PCNA expression in kidneys of Fe-NTA-treated rats. Consumption with HW decreased the incidence of renal cell carcinoma and suppressed tumor growth in Fe-NTA-treated in rats.

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) may ameliorate organ dysfunction in a rat model of polymicrobial sepsis. Methods: Sepsis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Twenty-four rats were equally assigned to Sham group, CLP group, and CLP + HRS group (n = 8). At 0, 6, and 18 h after CLP or sham operation, rats received an intraperitoneal injection of HRS (5 mL/kg) or the same volume of normal saline. Malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase activities, inflammatory mediators, pulmonary nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase activities, wet-to-dry weight ratio, histologic scores, apoptotic analysis, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen were assessed at 24 h after operation. The 7-d survival rate was also recorded. Results: HRS administration significantly reduced the serum high-mobility group box, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels; the pulmonary interleukin 6, high-mobility group box, nitric oxide, and malondialdehyde levels; and the wet-to-dry weight ratio, total histologic scores, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells, whereas it increased the superoxide dismutase activities 24 h after CLP when compared with the CLP group. However, there was no significant difference in survival rate between the CLP + HRS and CLP groups.

The aim of this study is to clarify the clinical effectiveness on wound healing in patients with PU by hydrogen-dissolved water (HW) intake via tube-feeding (TF). Furthermore, normal human dermal fibroblasts OUMS-36 and normal human epidermis-derived cell line HaCaT keratinocytes were examined in vitro to explore the mechanisms relating to whether hydrogen plays a role in wound-healing at the cellular level. Methods: Twenty-two severely hospitalized elderly Japanese patients with PU were recruited in the present study, and their ages ranged from 71.0 to 101.0 (86.7 ± 8.2) years old, 12 male and 10 female patients, all suffering from eating disorder and bedridden syndrome as the secondary results of various underlying diseases. All patients received routine care treatments for PU in combination with HW intake via TF for 600 mL per day, in place of partial moisture replenishment. On the other hand, HW was prepared with a hydrogen-bubbling apparatus which produces HW with 0.8-1.3 ppm of dissolved hydrogen concentration (DH) and -602 mV to -583 mV of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), in contrast to reversed osmotic ultra-pure water (RW), as the reference, with DH of < 0.018 ppm and ORP of +184 mV for use in the in vitro experimental research. In in vitro experiments, OUMS-36 fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes were respectively cultured in medium prepared with HW and/or RW. Immunostain was used for detecting type-I collagen reconstruction in OUMS-36 cells. And intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified by NBT assay, and cell viability of HaCaT cells was examined by WST-1 assay, respectively. Results: Twenty-two patients were retrospectively divided into an effective group (EG, n = 12) and a less effective group (LG, n = 10) according to the outcomes of endpoint evaluation and the healing criteria. PU hospitalized days in EG were significantly shorter than in LG (113.3 days vs. 155.4 days, p < 0.05), and the shortening rate was approximately 28.1%. Either in EG or in LG, the reducing changes (EG: 91.4%; LG: 48.6%) of wound size represented statistically significant difference versus before HW intake (p < 0.05, p < 0.001). The in vitro data demonstrate that intracellular ROS as quantified by NBT assay was diminished by HW, but not by RW, in ultraviolet-A (UVA)-irradiated HaCaT cells. Nuclear condensation and fragmentation had occurred for UVA-irradiated HaCaT cells in RW, but scarcely occurred in HW as demonstrated by Hoechst 33342 staining. Besides, under UVA-irradiation, either the mitochondrial reducing ability of HaCaT cells or the type-I collagen construction in OUMS-36 cells deteriorated in RW-prepared culture medium, but was retained in HW-prepared culture medium as shown by WST-1 assay or immunostain, respectively. Conclusions: HW intake via TF was demonstrated, for severely hospitalized elderly patients with PU, to execute wound size reduction and early recovery, which potently ensue from either type-I collagen construction in dermal fibroblasts or the promoted mitochondrial reducing ability and ROS repression in epidermal keratinocytes as shown by immunostain or NBT and WST-1 assays, respectively.

Wistar male rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (Group A, n = 15); septic shock group (Group B, n = 15); early fluid resuscitation-treated septic shock group (Group C, n = 15); and early fluid resuscitation and inhalation of 2% hydrogen-treated septic shock group (Group D, n = 15). The activity of hydroxyl radicals, myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), diamine oxidase (DAO), and the concentration of malonaldehyde (MDA) in the lung and intestinal tissue were assessed according to the corresponding kits. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was carried out to detect the pathology of the lung and intestine. The expression levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in lung and intestine tissue were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The expression levels of Fas and Bcl2 in lung tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Septic shock elicited a significant increase in the levels of MDA (10.17 ± 1.12 nmol/mg protein vs 2.98 ± 0.64 nmol/mg protein) and MPO (6.79 ± 1.02 U/g wet tissue vs 1.69 ± 0.14 U/g wet tissue) in lung tissues.

We investigated the potential neurovascular protective effect of hydrogen inhalation especially effect on mast cell activation in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage. Design: Controlled in vivo laboratory study. Setting: Animal research laboratory. Subjects: One hundred seventy-one 8-week-old male CD-1 mice were used. Interventions: Collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage model in 8-week-old male CD-1 mice was used. Hydrogen was administrated via spontaneous inhalation. The blood-brain barrier permeability and neurologic deficits were investigated at 24 and 72 hours after intracerebral hemorrhage. Mast cell activation was evaluated by Western blot and immuno-staining. The effects of hydrogen inhalation on mast cell activation were confirmed in an autologous blood injection model intracerebral hemorrhage. Measurement and main results: At 24 and 72 hours post intracerebral hemorrhage, animals showed blood-brain barrier disruption, brain edema, and neurologic deficits, accompanied with phosphorylation of Lyn kinase and release of tryptase, indicating mast cell activation. Hydrogen treatment diminished phosphorylation of Lyn kinase and release of tryptase, decreased accumulation and degranulation of mast cells, attenuated blood-brain barrier disruption, and improved neurobehavioral function.

H₂ supplementation of drinking water has been shown to exert disease-modifying effects in PD patients and neuroprotective effects in experimental PD model mice. However, H₂ supplementation does not result in detectable changes in striatal H₂ levels, indicating an indirect effect. Here we show that H₂ supplementation increases gastric expression of mRNA encoding ghrelin, a growth hormone secretagogue, and ghrelin secretion, which are antagonized by the β1-adrenoceptor blocker, atenolol. Strikingly, the neuroprotective effect of H₂ water was abolished by either administration of the ghrelin receptor-antagonist, D-Lys(3) GHRP-6, or atenolol. Thus, the neuroprotective effect of H₂ in PD is mediated by enhanced production of ghrelin. Our findings point to potential, novel strategies for ameliorating pathophysiology in which a protective effect of H₂ supplementation has been demonstrated.

Thus, there is a paucity of information regarding both the beneficial therapeutic effects as well as the side effects of H2 on acute cerebral ischemia in humans. We designed a pilot study to investigate single dose intravenous H2-administration in combination with edaravone, aiming to provide an initial estimate of the possible risks and benefits in select patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. An open-label, prospective, non-randomized study of intravenous H2-administration was performed in 38 patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke.

Our objective in this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel cold storage device equipped with a hydrogen-rich water bath. Methods: The study used an established rat heterotopic transplantation model. Syngeneic heart grafts from elderly donors (60- to 70-week-old Lewis rats) or allografts from adult donors (12-week-old Brown Norway rats) were exposed to prolonged cold preservation. The cardiac grafts were stored in plastic bags containing Celsior, which were immersed in the cold water bath equipped with an electrolyzer to saturate the water with hydrogen. The cardiac grafts then were heterotopically engrafted into Lewis rat recipients. Results: In both experimental settings, serum troponin I and creatine phosphokinase were markedly elevated 3 hours after reperfusion in the control grafts without hydrogen treatment. The grafts exhibited prominent inflammatory responses, including neutrophil infiltration and the upregulation of messenger RNAs for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Myocardial injury and inflammatory events were significantly attenuated by organ storage in the hydrogen-rich water bath. The grafts stored using the hydrogen-rich water bath also exhibited less mitochondrial damage and a higher adenosine triphosphate content. Conclusions: Hydrogen delivery to cardiac grafts during cold preservation using a novel hydrogen-supplemented water bath efficiently ameliorated myocardial injury due to cold ischemia and reperfusion. This new device to saturate organs with hydrogen during cold storage merits further investigation for possible therapeutic and preventative use during transplantation.

A positive correlation between oxidative stress and aging has been proved in many model organisms. In Caenorhabditis elegans, many long-lived mutants showed reduced fertility as a trade off against longevity phenotype. We aimed to study the effect of ERW on oxidative stress, fertility and lifespan of C. elegans. We also investigated the genetic pathway involved in the effect of ERW on resistance to oxidative stress and lifespan. We compared lifespan and fertility of worms in media prepared with distilled water and ERW. ERW significantly extended lifespan and increased the number of progeny produced. Then the effect of ERW on resistance to oxidative stress and lifespan of long-lived mutants was determined. ERW increased resistance to oxidative stress and lifespan of eat-2, a genetic model of dietary restriction, but had no effect on those of age-1, which is involved in insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1-like signal. In addition, knockdown of daf-16, the downstream mediator of insulin/IGF-1-like signal, completely prevented the effect of ERW on lifespan.

However, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a lethal complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which limits its application. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 play an extremely important role in the formation and development of aGVHD. Reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals, also play an important role in the formation and development of aGVHD. In recent years, hydrogen was reported to have an ability to inhibit the levels of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 in vivo, and it also has a strong selective free radical-scavenging ability. Therefore, we hypothesized that hydrogen may have therapeutic effects on aGVHD. To determine whether hydrogen could protect mice from lethal GVHD in a major histocompatibility complex-incompatible murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model, survival rates of mice were calculated and leukocyte counts were also determined after BMT. We also examined serum cytokine levels and scored clinical signs of GVHD mice after BMT. This article demonstrated that the administration of hydrogen-rich saline increased the survival rate and clinical score of aGVHD mice. Administration of hydrogen-rich saline after transplantation also promoted the recovery of white blood cells of aGVHD mice. However, there was no report on the therapeutic effects of hydrogen on aGVHD. It is suggested that hydrogen has a potential as an effective and safe therapeutic agent on aGVHD.",Positive,Mouse,Bone Marrow,Surgery/Transplantation,Graft-Versus-Hose-Disease,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

Methods: NEC was induced in male newborn Sprague–Dawley rats by formula feeding, exposure to asphyxia and cold stress. Sixty-four rat pups were divided randomly into four groups: C + NS (n = 11), C + H2 (n = 11), NEC + NS (n = 20), and NEC + H2 (n = 22). Rats in the former two groups were mother-fed. Pups received intra-peritoneal injection of HRS (10 ml/kg, 10 min before asphyxia stress twice a day) or the same dose of normal saline. Rats were monitored until 96 h after birth. Body weight, histological NEC score, survival time, malondialdehyde, antioxidant capacity, inflammatory mediators, and mucosal integrity were assessed. Results: HRS treatment maintained the body weight, reduced the incidence of NEC from 85% (17/20) to 54.5% (12/22), increased the survival rate from 25% (5/20) to 68.2% (15/22), and attenuated the severity of NEC. In addition, HRS inhibited the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6), down-regulated lipid peroxidation, enhanced total antioxidant capacity, and prevented the increase of diamine oxidase in serum. However, no significant influence of HRS on the interleukin-10 mRNA expression was observed.

Here, we investigated the effects of the atomic hydrogen surrounded by water molecules, H(H2O)m, on acute UV-induced responses and as well as skin aging. Interestingly, we observed that H(H2O)m application to human skin prevented UV-induced erythema and DNA damage. And H(H2O)m significantly prevented UV-induced MMP-1, COX-2, IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA expressions in human skin in vivo. We found that H(H2O)m prevented UV-induced ROS generation and inhibited UV-induced MMP-1, COX-2 and IL-6 expressions, and UV-induced JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation in HaCaT cells. Next, we investigated the effects of H(H2O)m on intrinsically aged or photoaged skin of elderly subjects. In intrinsically aged skin, H(H2O)m application significantly reduced constitutive expressions of MMP-1, IL-6, and IL-1β mRNA. Additionally, H(H2O)m significantly increased procollagen mRNA and also decreased MMP-1 and IL-6 mRNA expressions in photoaged facial skin. These results demonstrated that local application of H(H2O)m may prevent UV-induced skin inflammation and can modulate intrinsic skin aging and photoaging processes.

However, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by NO causes myocardial dysfunction and injury. Since H2 is reported to eliminate peroxynitrite, it was expected to reduce the adverse effects of NO. In mice, left anterior descending coronary artery ligation for 60 min followed by reperfusion was performed with inhaled NO (80 ppm), H2 (2%), or NO + H2, starting 5 min before reperfusion for 35 min. After 24 hrs, left ventricular function, the infarct size and area at risk (AAR) were assessed. Oxidative stress associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated by staining for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, that associated with RNS by staining for nitrotyrosine, and neutrophil infiltration by staining for granulocyte receptor-1. The infarct size/AAR decreased with breathing NO or H2 alone. NO inhalation plus H2 reduced the infarct size/AAR, with significant interaction between the two, reducing ROS and neutrophil infiltration, and improved the cardiac function to normal levels. While nitrotyrosine staining was prominent after NO inhalation alone, it was eliminated after breathing a mixture of H2 with NO. Preconditioning with NO significantly reduced the infarct size/AAR, but not preconditioning with H2. In conclusion, breathing NO + H2 during I-R reduced the infarct size and maintained cardiac function, and reduced the generation of myocardial nitrotyrosine associated with NO inhalation.

Introduction: Recently, it has been suggested that hydrogen gas exerts a therapeutic antioxidant activity by selectively reducing cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether treatment with molecular hydrogen alleviated bone loss induced by modeled microgravity in rats. Methods: Hindlimb suspension (HLS) and rotary wall vessel bioreactor were used to model microgravity in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to HLS for 6 weeks to induced bone loss and simultaneously administrated with hydrogen water (HW). Then, we investigated the effects of incubation with hydrogen-rich medium (HRM) on MC3T3-E1 and RAW264.7 cells exposed to modeled microgravity. Results: Treatment with HW alleviated HLS-induced reduction of bone mineral density, ultimate load, stiffness, and energy in femur and lumbar vertebra. Treatment with HW alleviated HLS-induced augmentation of malondialdehyde content and peroxynitrite content and reduction of total sulfhydryl content in femur and lumbar vertebra. In cultured MC3T3-E1 cells, incubation with HRM inhibited modeled microgravity-induced ROS formation, reduction of osteoblastic differentiation, increase of ratio of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand to osteoprotegerin, inducible nitric oxide synthetase upregulation, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. In cultured RAW264.7, incubation with HRM aggravated modeled microgravity-induced ROS formation, osteoclastic differentiation, and osteoclastogenesis. Conclusion: Treatment with molecular hydrogen alleviates microgravity-induced bone loss in rats. Molecular hydrogen could thus be envisaged as a nutritional countermeasure for spaceflight but remains to be tested in humans.

In this study we evaluated whether administrating H2 during the prolonged cold ischemia stage by adding it to Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate (HTK) solution fortifies preservation for cardiac grafts. Methods: One hundred and twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were equally randomized to four groups: three H2-rich HTK-treated groups with H2 of different concentrations and traditional HTK-treated group as the control group. Isolated hearts were mounted on the Langendorff apparatus for aerobic perfusion. Following baseline hemodynamic measurements, grafts were arrested and stored in HTK with or without H2 for 6h at 4°C. After this prolonged cold storage, grafts were reperfused and concerned parameters were examined. Results: Compared with the control group, preservation in H2-rich HTK significantly enhanced the percentage recovery of hemodynamic parameters, which was parallel to the diminished re-beating time and improved microscopic morphology of myocardium. Oxidative stress associated parameters including 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were decreased while myocardial superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was preserved.

Each horse was subjected to a maximum level of treadmill exercise in which the horses were exhausted at an average speed of 13.2 ± 0.84 m/sec. Blood samples were taken 4 times, immediately before the intake of HW or placebo water at 30 min preceding the treadmill exercise, immediately before the exercise (pre-exercise), immediately after the exercise (post-exercise) and at 30 min following the exercise. In all horses, both d-ROMs and BAP values significantly increased at post-exercise. The increase in d-ROMs tended to be lower in the HW trial, as compared to the placebo trial at pre-exercise. The increase in BAP was considerable at approximately 150% of the pre-exercise values in both the HW and placebo treatment trials. The BAP/d-ROMs ratio was significantly elevated at post-exercise in both treatment trials, while a significant elevation was also observed at pre-exercise in the HW trial.

Previous studies indicated marked but only transient (1-4 h) reactive oxygen species-dependent neurovascular dysfunction in newborn pigs after severe hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) stress contributing to the neuronal injury after birth asphyxia. Objectives: Our major purpose was to determine if neurovascular dysfunction would also occur later, at 24 h after a milder H/I stress. We also tested if the putative hydroxyl radical scavenger hydrogen (H2) exerted neurovascular protection. Methods: Anesthetized, ventilated piglets were assigned to three groups of 9 animals: time control, asphyxia/reventilation with air, and asphyxia/reventilation with air +2.1% H2 for 4 h. Asphyxia was induced by suspending ventilation for 8 min. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CR) of pial arterioles was determined using closed cranial window/intravital microscopy 24 h after asphyxia to the endothelium-dependent cerebrovascular stimulus hypercapnia, the neuronal function-dependent stimulus N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), norepinephrine, and sodium nitroprusside. The brains were subjected to histopathology. Results: Hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and core temperature did not differ significantly among the experimental groups. In the early reventilation period, the recovery of electroencephalographic activity was significantly better in H2-treated animals. Asphyxia/reventilation severely attenuated CR to hypercapnia and NMDA; however, reactivity to norepinephrine and sodium nitroprusside were unaltered. H2 fully or partially preserved CR to hypercapnia or NMDA, respectively. Histopathology revealed modest neuroprotection afforded by H2.

Objectives: This study is designed to test whether hydrogen (H(2))-rich saline will have a protective effect on rats with acute CO poisoning. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to CO poisoning. H(2)-rich saline was administered by peritoneal injection (6 mL/kg/24 h). We used the Morris water maze and the open field test to determine cognitive function. After cognitive function studies, rats were decapitated and the levels of trace elements copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) in serum and brain were assessed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy of neurons were assessed by H-E staining and immunohistochemical staining in another group of rats. Results: H(2)-rich saline treatment improved the cognitive deficits and reduced the degree of necrosis, apoptosis, and cell autophagy in rats. Additionally, H(2)-rich saline decreased the content of Fe in serum and brain in these rats, and increased the content of serum Cu related to free radical metabolism. Conclusions: H(2)-rich saline may effectively protect the brain from injury after acute CO poisoning. The mechanism of this protection may be related to lessening oxidative damage by affecting trace elements in vivo.

Sprague-Dawley rat pups were divided into the following groups: control (Group A), selenite induced (Group B), and selenite plus hydrogen saline treated (Group C). Rat pups in Groups B and C received a single subcutaneous injection of sodium selenite (25 μmol/kg bodyweight) on postnatal day 12. Group C also received an intraperitoneal injection of H2 saline (5 ml/kg bodyweight) daily from postnatal day 8 to postnatal day 17. The development of cataract was assessed weekly by slit-lamp examination for 2 weeks. After sacrifice, extricated lenses were analyzed for activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase, levels of malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione (GSH), and total sulfhydryl contents. The magnitude of lens opacification in Group B was significantly higher than in Group A (p<0.05), while Group C had less opacification than Group B (p<0.05). Compared with Group B, the mean activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase, levels of GSH, and total sulfhydryl contents were higher, whereas the level of malondialdehyde was lower following treatment with hydrogen saline(p<0.05). This is an initial report showing that hydrogen saline can prevent selenite-induced cataract in rats.

Materials and methods: H(2) was dissolved in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium under high pressure (0.4 Mpa) to a saturated level by using an apparatus produced by our department. A 2-[6-(4'-hydroxy) phenoxy-3H-xanthen-3-on-9-yl] benzoate (HPF) probe and a 2',7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFH-DA) fluorescent dye were used to measure the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Cell apoptosis were determined by double-staining with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Annexin V-FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) as well as a Hoechst 33342 staining method alternatively. Subsequently, cell cycle analysis was performed using a PI staining method and the expression of apoptotic protein was examined by Western blot. Results: In this study, we demonstrated H(2) reduced ROS level in Human lymphocyte AHH-1 cells as well as in the radiolysis of water. Our data also showed H(2) attenuated (12)C(6+) radiation- induced cell apoptosis and also alleviated radiation-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. Heavy ion radiation-induced Caspase 3 activation was also inhibited by H(2) treatment. Conclusion: In conclusion, these data showed that H(2) attenuated (12)C(6+) radiation-induced cell apoptosis through reducing the ROS level and modulating apoptotic molecules, thus indicating the potential of H(2) as a safe and effective radioprotectant.

Although the mechanisms are largely unknown, the neurotoxicity may, at least in part, be due to elevated oxidative stress caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. In an investigation of potential therapies that could protect against this type of damage, we studied the effects of molecular hydrogen on anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in the developing mouse brain. Methods: Six-day-old C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 6 h with or without hydrogen (< 1.3%) as part of the carrier gas mixture. Apoptosis was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for cleaved caspase-3 (n = 8-10/group). Western blot analysis for cleaved poly-(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase was also performed to examine apoptosis (n = 3-6/group). Oxidative stress was assessed by immunohistochemical staining for 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (n = 8/group). Long-term memory and social behavior were examined using the fear conditioning test and the sociability test, respectively (n = 18-20/group). Results: Western blot analysis showed that coadministration of 1.3% hydrogen gas significantly (P < 0.001) reduced the level of neuronal apoptosis to approximately 40% compared with sevoflurane exposure alone. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that hydrogen reduced oxidative stress induced by neonatal sevoflurane exposure. Although neonatal sevoflurane exposure caused impairment in long-term memory and abnormal social behaviors in adulthood, mice coadministered hydrogen gas with sevoflurane did not exhibit these deficits. Conclusions: Inhalation of hydrogen gas robustly decreased neuronal apoptosis and subsequent cognitive impairments caused by neonatal exposure to sevoflurane.

The characteristic histological features of As-BD include full-layer epidermal dysplasia, apoptosis, and abnormal proliferation. Calcium propagation is an essential cellular event contributing to keratinocyte differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, all of which occur in As-BD. This study investigated how arsenic interferes calcium propagation of skin keratinocytes through ROS production and whether hydrogen-enriched water would restore arsenic-impaired calcium propagation. Arsenic was found to induce oxidative stress and inhibit ATP- and thapsigaragin-induced calcium propagation. Pretreatment of arsenic-treated keratinocytes by hydrogen-enriched water or beta-mercaptoethanol with potent anti-oxidative effects partially restored the propagation of calcium by ATP and by thapsigaragin.

Lactulose can produce considerable amount of hydrogen through fermentation by the bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. To determine the neuroprotective effects of lactulose against cerebral I/R injury in rats and explore the probable mechanisms, we carried out this study. The stroke model was produced on Sprague-Dawley(SD) rats through middle cerebral artery occlusion(MCAO). Intragastric administration of lactulose substantially increased hydrogen breath concentration. Behavioral and histopathological verifications matched biochemical findings. Behaviorally, rats in lactulose administration group won higher neurological scores and showed shorter escape latency time in Morris test. Morphologically, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) showed smaller infarction volume; Nissl staining manifested relatively clear and intact neurons and TUNEL staining showed less apoptotic neurons. Biochemically, lactulose decreased brain malondialdehyde(MDA) content, caspase-3 activity, 3-nitrotyrosine(3-NT) and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine(8-OHdG) concentration and increased superoxide dismutase(SOD) activity. And the effects of lactulose were superior to edaravone. Lactulose orally administered activated the expression of NF-E2-related factor 2(Nrf2) in the brain verified by RT-PCR and Western blot.

On postoperative Day 5, flap survival, blood perfusion, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and levels of cytokines were evaluated. Histological examinations were performed to assess inflammatory cell infiltration. Results: Skin flap survival and blood flow perfusion were improved by HRS relative to the controls. The production of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of lipid peroxidation, was markedly reduced. A multiplex cytokine assay revealed that HRS reduced the elevation in the levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, with the exception of RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) growth factor.

Though clinical symptoms could be ameliorated by bone marrow transplantation and/or immunosuppressive therapy, frequent recurrence and especially evolution of clonal hematologic diseases remains problematic clinically. Cytokines such as interferon-γ (INF-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secreted by autologous T cells are closely related with the development of AA. Hydrogen-rich solution was reported to inhibit the levels of cytokines including INF-γ, TNF-α and IL-6 in vivo in recent studies. This study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of hydrogen-rich solution on AA in vivo. Methods: AA model was determined in vivo by mice and body weights of the mice were used as the basic physiological index. Peripheral blood cells were calculated to evaluate the hematologic recovery degree. Bone marrow nucleated cells (BMNCs), tissue histology, as well as CFU-S and CFU-GM forming units were used to evaluate the recovery of bone marrow microenvironment. The ratio of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells were examined along with cytokine levels in serum to determine the efficacy of H2-rich solution on the affected immunological functions. Results: Body weight and number of peripheral blood cells were significantly improved for mice in the H2-rich solution treated groups as compared with those with AA. The number of BMNCs and CFUs increased markedly and the bone marrow microenvironment was also improved significantly. The experimental group restrained the cell apoptosis, relieved hyperemia and accelerated tissue repair. The number of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells as well as the ratio of CD4/CD8 increased to normal gradually, while the levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6 in serum decreased after H2-rich solution treatment.

The present study was designed to investigate the beneficial effects of HS against spinal cord I/R injury and its associated mechanisms. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by infrarenal aortic occlusion for 20min in male New Zealand white rabbits. Different doses of HS were intravenously (i.v.) administered at 5min before or after the beginning of reperfusion. Moreover, the roles of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels (mitoKATP), oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis was assessed. Here, we found that I/R-challenged rabbits exhibited significant spinal cord injury characterized by the decreased numbers of normal motor neurons and hind-limb motor dysfunction, which was significantly ameliorated by 5mL/kg and 10mL/kg HS treatment before reperfusion or 10mL/kg HS treatment after reperfusion. However, the protective effects of HS treatment in spinal cord I/R injury were partially abolished by the selective mitoKATP channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD). Moreover, we showed that the beneficial effects of 10mL/kg HS treatment against spinal cord I/R damage were associated with the decreased levels of oxidative products [8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α) and malondialdehyde (MDA)] and pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)], as well as the increased activities of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)] in serum at 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h after reperfusion and in spinal cord at 72h after reperfusion. Furthermore, HS treatment (10mL/kg) reduced caspase-3 activity in the spinal cord of this model. Thus, HS may be an effective therapeutic agent for spinal cord I/R injury via activation of mitoKATP channels as well as reduction of oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis.

Recently, the protective role of hydrogen (H2 ) in the brain has been widely studied, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Numerous studies have shown nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) as a crucial survival pathway in neurons. Here we investigated the role of H2 in EBI following SAH, focusing on the NF-κB pathway. A double blood injection model was used to produce experimental SAH, and H2 -rich saline was injected intraperitoneally. NF-κB activity within the occipital cortex was measured. Immunofluorescence was performed to demonstrate the activation of NF-κB; Bcl-xL and cleaved caspase-3 were determined via Western blot. Gene expression of Bcl-xL was detected by real-time PCR, and TUNEL and Nissl staining were performed to illustrate brain injury in the occipital cortex. SAH induced a significant increase of cleaved caspase-3. Correspondingly, TUNEL staining demonstrated obvious neuronal apoptosis following SAH. In contrast, H2 treatment markedly increased NF-κB activity and the expression of Bcl-xL and decreased the level of cleaved caspase-3. Additionally, H2 treatment significantly reduced post-SAH neuronal apoptosis.

One of the major events in I/R injury is the generation of cytotoxic oxygen radicals. Recently, hydrogen gas has been reported to display antioxidant properties and protective effects against organ dysfunction induced by various I/R injuries. We investigated whether hydrogen-rich University of Wisconsin (HRUW) solution attenuates renal cold I/R injury. Methods: We prepared HRUW solution by a novel method involving immersion of centrifuge tubes containing UW solution into hydrogen-saturated water. Hydrogen readily permeates through the centrifuge tubes, and thus, the hydrogen concentration of the UW solution gradually increases in a time-dependent manner. Syngeneic rat kidney transplantation was performed, and the animals were divided into three groups: recipients with nonpreserved grafts (control group), recipients with grafts preserved in UW solution for 24 to 48 hr (UW group), and recipients with grafts preserved in HRUW solution for 24 to 48 hr (HRUW group). Results: In the early phases, HRUW solution decreased oxidative stress, tubular apoptosis, and interstitial macrophage infiltration in the kidney grafts. Consequently, HRUW solution improved renal function and prolonged recipient survival rate compared with simple cold storage using UW solution. Histopathologically, HRUW treatment alleviated tubular injury and suppressed development of interstitial fibrosis. Conclusions: HRUW solution improved graft function and prolonged graft survival compared with simple cold storage using UW solution by protecting tubular epithelial cells from inflammation and apoptosis. Our new method of organ preservation is a groundbreaking, safe, and simple strategy that may be applied in the clinical setting.

Recently it has been said that hydrogen can function as antioxidant, so we investigated the effect of hydrogen-rich water (HW) on oxidative stress and muscle fatigue in response to acute exercise. Methods: Ten male soccer players aged 20.9 ± 1.3 years old were subjected to exercise tests and blood sampling. Each subject was examined twice in a crossover double-blind manner; they were given either HW or placebo water (PW) for one week intervals. Subjects were requested to use a cycle ergometer at a 75 % maximal oxygen uptake (VO2) for 30 min, followed by measurement of peak torque and muscle activity throughout 100 repetitions of maximal isokinetic knee extension. Oxidative stress markers and creatine kinase in the peripheral blood were sequentially measured. Results: Although acute exercise resulted in an increase in blood lactate levels in the subjects given PW, oral intake of HW prevented an elevation of blood lactate during heavy exercise. Peak torque of PW significantly decreased during maximal isokinetic knee extension, suggesting muscle fatigue, but peak torque of HW didn't decrease at early phase. There was no significant change in blood oxidative injury markers (d-ROMs and BAP) or creatine kinease after exercise. Conclusion: Adequate hydration with hydrogen-rich water pre-exercise reduced blood lactate levels and improved exercise-induced decline of muscle function. Although further studies to elucidate the exact mechanisms and the benefits are needed to be confirmed in larger series of studies, these preliminary results may suggest that HW may be suitable hydration for athletes.

As hydrogen-rich water (HW) scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), we hypothesized that HW could prevent lipid deposition induced by periodontitis in the aorta. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HW on the initiation of atherosclerosis in a rat periodontitis model. Design: Eighteen 8-wk-old male Wistar rats were divided into three groups of six rats; the periodontitis group, periodontitis+HW group and the no treatment (control) group. In the periodontitis and periodontitis+HW groups, periodontitis was induced using a ligature for 4 wk, while the periodontitis+HW group was given water containing 800-1000 μg/L hydrogen during the 4-wk experimental period. Results: In the periodontitis group, lipid deposition in the descending aorta was observed. The periodontitis group also showed significant higher serum levels for ROS and oxidised low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (ox-LDL) (1.7 and 1.4 times, respectively), and higher aortic expression levels of nitrotyrosine and hexanoyl-lysine (HEL) (7.9 and 16.0 times, respectively), as compared to the control group (p<0.05). In the periodontitis+HW group, lipid deposition was lower. Lower serum levels of ROS and ox-LDL (0.46 and 0.82 times, respectively) and lower aortic levels of nitrotyrosine and HEL (0.27 and 0.19 times, respectively) were observed in the periodontitis+HW group than in the periodontitis group (p<0.05). Conclusions: HW intake may prevent lipid deposition in the rat aorta induced by periodontitis by decreasing serum ox-LDL levels and aortic oxidative stress.

The retinal damage of rats was induced by blue light exposure for 6 hours and examined 8 hours, 16 hours and 24 hours after the exposure. One hundred female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 included 30 rats received light exposure without any other treatment. Group 2 included 30 rats received light exposure with intraperitoneal injection of normal saline. Group 3 included 30 rats received light exposure with intraperitoneal injection of saturated hydrogen saline. And Group 4 included the other 10 rats which did not receive any treatment. The amount of intraperitoneal injection of saturated hydrogen saline and normal saline was calculated in the ratio of 1ml/100g of rat weight. Specimens were collected and processed by H-E staining, ultrastructure observation, biochemical measurement. Morphological changes were observed by light microscope and transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness was measured by IPP 6.0, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured by colorimetric determination at 532 nm. Although the structure of retina in Group 1 and Group 2 was injured heavily, the injury in Group 3 was mild. The differences between Group 1 and Group 2 were not significant. Compared with the rats in Group 1 and Group 2, the ones in Group 3 had more clearly demarcated retina structure and more ordered cells by light microscope and TEM observation. The ONL thicknesses (400 times) of four groups at each time point except between Group 1 and Group 2 were significantly different (P<0.05). The thicknesses of the ONL in Group 1 at three time points were 30.41±4.04µm, 26.11±2.82µm and 20.63±1.06µm, in Group 2 were 31.62±4.54µm, 25.08±3.63µm and 19.07±3.86µm, in Group 3 were 29.75±3.62µm, 28.83±1.97µm and 27.61±1.83µm. In Group 4 the mean of the thickness was 37.35±1.37µm. As time went by, the damage grew more severely. At 24h point, the differences were most significant. Compared with Group 4, the thickness was 46.23% thinner in Group 1, 50.29% thinner in Group 2 and 28.04% thinner in Group 3. The stack structures of membranous disc in Group 3 were injured slightly, but in Group 1 and Group 2 the damage was more obvious by TEM.

It has also been reported to accelerate wound healing; thus, it is particularly attractive for the elimination or minimization of the microbial population of skin grafts to be used as wound dressings. Methods: Pigskins were sterilized with different concentrations of NEW and with different methods. The feasibility of pigskin sterilization by NEW was evaluated through microbiological analyses, viability assays, histologic assessments, contact cytotoxicity assays, and extract cytotoxicity assays. Results: NEW has strong bactericidal effects on pigskin microorganisms, does not change skin graft histologic properties, and has no cytotoxicity; however, skin viability was significantly reduced after NEW treatment. Conclusion: Although NEW treatment is a very safe and effective method for nonviable pigskin dressing sterilization, to obtain a complete sterilization of pigskin grafts, available chlorine concentration of NEW as well as sterilization time and methods should be optimized.

Two-vessel occlusion rat model was used to produce 10-minute transient global cerebral ischemia. One hundred and twenty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into sham, sham+H(2), ischemia, and ischemia+H(2) groups (n = 30 each group). Inhalation of 2% hydrogen gas was performed immediately at the end of operation and lasted for 3 hours. Cognitive function of rats was evaluated via Morris water maze. Neuronal damage in the CA1 region was quantified according to their morphological changes revealed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The levels of oxidative stress products malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha, and the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase were measured to investigate the effects of inhalation of hydrogen gas on oxidative stress. Inhalation of hydrogen gas decreased significantly the average latency of the ischemic rats in finding hidden platform and elongated markedly their retention in the target quadrant. The neuronal density 3·3±2·1 cells/mm in CA1 region of the ischemic rats increased to 21·7±2·6 cells/mm after they were treated with hydrogen gas. Moreover, hydrogen gas made higher levels of MDA and 8-iso-PGF2α in the ischemic rats attenuate to 3·2±0·2, 3·5±0·5, 3·4±0·3 and 26·4±2·3, 28·2±2·6, 26·8±2·1 at reperfusion 4, 24, and 72 hours, respectively (P<0·01 versus ischemia group at each indicated time).

This study tested the hypothesis that inhalation of H(2) gas starting at the beginning of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) could improve the outcome of CA. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by transcutaneous electrical epicardial stimulation in rats. After 5 minutes of the subsequent CA, rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental groups at the beginning of CPR: mechanical ventilation (MV) with 2% N(2) and 98% O(2) under normothermia (37°C), the control group; MV with 2% H(2) and 98% O(2) under normothermia; MV with 2% N(2) and 98% O(2) under therapeutic hypothermia (TH), 33°C; and MV with 2% H(2) and 98% O(2) under TH.

Despite its clinical significance and extensive research, the underlying pathogenesis and therapeutic perspectives of CV remain incompletely understood. Recently, it has been suggested that molecular hydrogen (H(2)) can selectively reduce levels of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and ameliorate oxidative and inflammatory injuries to organs in many models. However, whether H(2) can ameliorate CV after SAH is still unknown. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of H(2) in preventing SAH-induced CV. Experimental SAH was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using cisterna magna blood injection. Hydrogen-rich saline (HS) was injected intraperitoneally (5 ml/kg) immediately and at 24 hr after injury. All rats were sacrificed 48 hr after the neurological examination scores had been recorded following SAH. Levels of oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated. Basilar artery vasospasm was assessed by histological examination using light and transmission electron microscopy. HS treatment significantly improved neurological outcomes and attenuated morphological vasospasm of the basilar artery after SAH. In addition, we found that the beneficial effects of HS treatment on SAH-induced CV were associated with decreased levels of lipid peroxidation, increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, and reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the basilar artery. These results indicate that H(2) has the potential to be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CV after SAH, and its neuroprotective effect might be partially mediated via limitation of vascular inflammation and oxidative stress.

Although its etiology is unknown, the hydroxyl radical has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of RA. Recently, molecular hydrogen (H2) was demonstrated to be a selective scavenger for the hydroxyl radical. Also, the method to prepare water containing extremely high concentration of H2 has been developed. We hypothesized that H2 in the water could complement conventional therapy by reducing the oxidative stress in RA. Methods: Twenty patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drank 530 ml of water containing 4 to 5 ppm molecular hydrogen (high H2 water) every day for 4 weeks. After a 4-week wash-out period, the patients drank the high H2 water for another 4 weeks. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine (8-OHdG) and disease activity (DAS28, using C-reactive protein [CRP] levels) was estimated at the end of each 4-week period. Results: Drinking high H2 water seems to raise the concentration of H2 more than the H2 saturated (1.6 ppm) water in vivo. Urinary 8-OHdG was significantly reduced by 14.3% (p < 0.01) on average. DAS28 also decreased from 3.83 to 3.02 (p < 0.01) during the same period. After the wash-out period, both the urinary 8-OHdG and the mean DAS28 decreased, compared to the end of the drinking period. During the second drinking period, the mean DAS28 was reduced from 2.83 to 2.26 (p < 0.01). Urinary 8-OHdG was not further reduced but remained below the baseline value. All the 5 patients with early RA (duration < 12 months) who did not show antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (ACPAs) achieved remission, and 4 of them became symptom-free at the end of the study. Conclusions: The results suggest that the hydroxyl radical scavenger H2 effectively reduces oxidative stress in patients with this condition. The symptoms of RA were significantly improved with high H2 water.

We then measured the brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, neurological dysfunction and injury volume in all animals. In addition, the oxidative products and antioxidant enzymes in brain tissues were detected. Results: TBI-challenged rats exhibited significant brain injuries characterized by the increase of BBB permeability, brain edema, and lesion volume as well as neurological dysfunction, which were dose-dependently ameliorated by HS treatment. Moreover, we found that HS treatment increased the endogenous antioxidant enzymatic activities and decreased the oxidative product levels in brain tissues of TBI-challenged rats.

HRW inhibited glucose- and α,β-dicarbonyl compound-induced ROS production in kidney homogenates from Wistar rats in vitro. Furthermore, SHR.Cg-Leprcp/NDmcr rats treated with HRW showed a 34% decrease in ROS production. Moreover, their renal glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone levels decreased by 81%, 77%, and 60%, respectively. Positive correlations were found between renal ROS levels and renal glyoxal (r = 0.659, p = 0.008) and methylglyoxal (r = 0.782, p = 0.001) levels. These results indicate that HRW inhibits the production of α,β-dicarbonyl compounds and ROS in the kidneys of SHR.Cg-Leprcp/NDmcr rats. Therefore, it has therapeutic potential for renal dysfunction in patient with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.",Positive,Rat,Kidney,Diabetes (Type II),Diabetic Nephropathy,Water (Mg-Chemico),Alkaline,Ingestion,,,Japan

And we evaluated the antioxidant activity of Pt/PVP-colloid in HW or RW on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and improvement of blood fluidity under 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidative stress. When applied with the 0.25-0.5 ppm Pt/PVP-colloid in RW or HW, the level of DPPH radicals decreased to 77.5-59.6% or 16.1-5.6%, in contrast to the level as high as 81.3% for HW alone, respectively, as measured by an electron spin resonance method. The horse blood, which was subjected to AAPH-induced oxidative stress, was incubated for 24 hr with RW or HW, and thereafter required 13.7 sec (100%) or 5.7 sec (42.3%) for passing through the micro-channels in a rheology equipment. When treated with 0.5-1.0 ppm Pt/PVP-colloid in RW or HW, the blood passage time in the micro-channels decreased dose-dependently to 9.7-7.3 sec (71.6-53.8%) or 4.3-1.3 sec (32.8-10.3%), and the rate of micro-channels clogged with erythrocyte aggregates decreased to 23.8-21.0% or 15.8-9.8%, respectively, from 42.8% for no addition of Pt/PVP. By scanning electron microscopy, AAPH-treated erythrocytes lost intact surface morphology on the membrane together with protrusions and without hollows, being indicative of impaired transforming ability, and the rate of erythrocyte agglutination was increased to 46.2%. When treated the horse blood with HW alone significantly decreased the rate of erythrocyte agglutination to 29.6%, whereas 1.0 ppm Pt/PVP-colloid in RW or HW decreased it to 24.1% or 21.1%, respectively. Thus, DPPH-radical-scavenging and erythrocyte-protecting effects of Pt/PVP-colloid in HW were superior to those of Pt/PVP-colloid in RW or Pt/PVP-free HW. The results could be mainly attributed to the enhanced antioxidant activity of Pt/PVP in HW, which may be due to captured-hydrogen on platinum.

Electrochemically reduced water (ERW), produced near the cathode during electrolysis, and scavenges intracellular H(2)O(2) in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. RT-PCR and zymography analyses revealed that when HT1080 cells were treated with ERW, the gene expression of MMP-2 and membrane type 1 MMP and activation of MMP-2 was repressed, resulting in decreased invasion of the cells into matrigel. ERW also inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced MMP-2 upregulation. To investigate signal transduction involved in MMP-2 downregulation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-specific inhibitors, SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), PD98059 (MAPK/extracellular regulated kinase kinase 1 inhibitor) and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase inhibitor II, were used to block the MAPK signal cascade. MMP-2 gene expression was only inhibited by SB203580 treatment, suggesting a pivotal role of p38 MAPK in regulation of MMP-2 gene expression. Western blot analysis showed that ERW downregulated the phosphorylation of p38 both in H(2)O(2)-treated and untreated HT1080 cells.

However, since cerebral ischemia patients are in old age group, the safety information needs to be confirmed. For the feasibility of H2 treatment in these patients, delivery of H2 by inhalation method needs to be checked for consistency. Methods: Hydrogen concentration (HC) in the arterial and venous blood was measured by gas chromatography on 3 patients, before, during and after 4% (case 1) and 3% (case2,3) H2 gas inhalation with simultaneous monitoring of physiological parameters. For a consistency study, HC in the venous blood of 10 patients were obtained on multiple occasions at the end of 30-min H2 inhalation treatment. Results: The HC gradually reached a plateau level in 20 min after H2 inhalation in the blood, which was equivalent to the level reported by animal experiments. The HC rapidly decreased to 10% of the plateau level in about 6 min and 18 min in arterial and venous blood, respectively after H2 inhalation was discontinued. Physiological parameters on these 3 patients were essentially unchanged by use of hydrogen. The consistency study of 10 patients showed the HC at the end of 30-min inhalation treatment was quite variable but the inconsistency improved with more attention and encouragement. Conclusion: H2 inhalation of at least 3% concentration for 30 min delivered enough HC, equivalent to the animal experiment levels, in the blood without compromising the safety.

Electrolyzed-reduced water (ERW) has an extremely negative oxidation-reduction potential. ERW scavenges cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppresses single-strand breaks of plasmid DNA in bacteria. Here, we examined the effect of ERW on resistance to oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. Oxidative DNA damage in human lymphocytes was significantly alleviated by ERW by reducing cellular ROS levels. Caenorhabditis elegans grown in media prepared with ERW had increased resistance to oxidative stress caused by paraquat. We observed a significant effect of ERW on response to other stressors, including heat shock and UV-irradiation in C. elegans. These data indicate that the powerful anti-oxidant activity of ERW is due to its radical-scavenging activity and show, for the first time, that ERW could increase thermotolerance and resistance to UV-irradiation. These results suggest that ERW aids resistance to various environmental stresses.",Positive,Nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans),Whole Body,Environmental Pollution,Pesticide Toxicity (Paraquat),Water (Electrolysis),Alkaline,Immersion,,,South Korea

Molecular hydrogen has emerged as a novel antioxidant and has been proven effective in treating many diseases. Objectives: We aimed to determine the mechanism by which hydrogen affects neointima formation. Methods: We assessed the influence of a hydrogen-rich saline solution (HRSS) by daily injection in rats. Rats were euthanized to evaluate the neointima. ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH), were detected in the injured artery. Macrophage infiltration and the production of inflammatory factors (i.e., IL-6, TNF-α and NF-κB) were also observed. The in vitro effects of hydrogen on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation were also measured. Results: HRSS decreased the neointima area significantly. The neointima/media ratio was also reduced by HRSS. There was a decline in the number of PCNA-positive cells in the intima treated with HRSS. Meanwhile, HRSS ameliorated the ROS and MDA levels and increased SOD, reduced GSH levels in the injured carotid. In addition, the levels of inflammatory factors, such as IL-6, TNF-α and NF-κB p65, were attenuated by HRSS. In vitro studies also confirmed the anti-proliferative capability of the hydrogen solution and ROS generation in VSMCs induced by PDGF-BB. Conclusion: HRSS may have a protective role in the prevention of neointima hyperplasia and restenosis after angioplasty. HRSS may partially exert its role by neutralizing the local ROS and suppressing the TNF-α/NF-κB pathway.

This study was designed to investigate whether treatment with molecular hydrogen (H(2)), which can remedy damage in various organs via reducing oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, is beneficial to ouabain-induced AN in gerbils. Methods: AN model was made by local application of ouabain (1 mmol/L, 20 mL) to the round window membrane in male Mongolian gerbils. H(2) treatment was given twice by exposing the animals to H(2) (1%, 2%, and 4%) for 60 min at 1 h and 6 h after ouabain application. Before and 7 d after ouabain application, the hearing status of the animals was evaluated using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) approach, the hear cell function was evaluated with distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Seven days after ouabain application, the changes in the cochleae, especially the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), were morphologically studied. TUNEL staining and immunofluorescent staining for activated caspase-3 were used to assess the apoptosis of SGNs. Results: Treatment with H(2) (2% and 4%) markedly attenuated the click and tone burst-evoked ABR threshold shift at 4, 8, and 16 kHz in ouabain-exposed animals. Neither local ouabain application, nor H(2) treatment changed the amplitude of DPOAE at 4, 8, and 16 kHz. Morphological study showed that treatment with H(2) (2%) significantly alleviated SGN damage and attenuated the loss of SGN density for each turn of cochlea in ouabain-exposed animals. Furthermore, ouabain caused significantly higher numbers of apoptotic SGNs in the cochlea, which was significantly attenuated by the H(2) treatment. However, ouabain did not change the morphology of cochlear hair cells. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that H(2) treatment is beneficial to ouabain-induced AN via reducing apoptosis. Thus, H(2) might be a potential agent for treating hearing impairment in AN patients.

Hydrogen-rich (H2) saline is an antioxidant treatment capable of ameliorating the severity of L-arginine-induced AP. In this study, we attempted to validate its protective role against traumatic pancreatitis (TP). A previously established experimental rat model of TP was generated by controlled delivery of high pressure air impact. The protective effects of H2 saline against TP were evaluated in this model system by measuring survival rate and determining changes in histopathology, plasma enzymes, cytokines, and oxidative stress-associated molecules. Intraperitoneal administration of H2-rich saline produced a pronounced protection against TP in rats. Significant improvements were observed in survival rate and histopathological findings. In addition, plasma cytokines concentrations were reduced in H2 saline-treated TP rats. Although no marked inhibitory effect on plasma amylase and lipase activities was observed, H2 saline caused considerable suppression of pancreatic malondialdehyde level and recruitment of endogenous pancreatic antioxidants, such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase. H2-rich saline has beneficial effects on TP, presumably because of its detoxification activities against excessive reactive oxygen species.

Plasma analysis by enzymatic method and spectrophotometric measurement showed that eight weeks intraperitoneally injection of hydrogen-saturated saline remarkably decreased plasma total and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol, and malondialdehyde in apoE-/- mice fed either chow or high fat diet. Western blot analysis showed hydrogen treatment reduced the contents of apolipoprotein B (apoB), a major protein constituent of non-HDL in either plasma or hepatic tissues. Moreover, ELISA assay revealed that the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 were significantly suppressed by hydrogen in RAW264.7 macrophages, after stimulation with the isolated non-HDL from treated or untreated mice. Immunohistochemistry of aortic valve sections revealed that hydrogen suppressed the expression of several proinflammatory factors and decreased vessel wall infiltration of macrophages.

The effect was suggested to be mediated by its free-radical scavenger properties. However, it has been shown recently that molecular hydrogen alters gene expression and protein phosphorylation. The aim of this study was to test whether chronic ad libitum consumption of molecular hydrogen-enriched electrochemically reduced water (H-ERW) improves the outcome of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. Seven days after the initiation of H-ERW treatment, C57Bl/6 mice received a single injection of LPS (0.33 mg/kg i.p.) or an equivalent volume of vehicle. The LPS-induced sickness behaviour was assessed 2 h after the injection, and recovery was assessed by monitoring the spontaneous locomotor activity in the homecage for 72 h after the administration of LPS. The mice were killed in the acute or recovery phase, and the expression of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus was assessed by real-time PCR. We found that molecular hydrogen reduces the LPS-induced sickness behaviour and promotes recovery. These effects are associated with a shift towards anti-inflammatory gene expression profile at baseline (downregulation of TNF- α and upregulation of IL-10). In addition, molecular hydrogen increases the amplitude, but shortens the duration and promotes the extinction of neuroinflammation. Consistently, molecular hydrogen modulates the activation and gene expression in a similar fashion in immortalized murine microglia (BV-2 cell line), suggesting that the effects observed in vivo may involve the modulation of microglial activation. Taken together, our data point to the regulation of cytokine expression being an additional critical mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of molecular hydrogen.

Hydrogen potently protects organs and cells from many insults via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. We investigated the efficacy of oral administration of hydrogen-rich water (HW) for prevention of intimal hyperplasia. Methods and results: The inferior vena cava was excised, stored in cold Ringer solution for 2 h, and placed as an interposition graft in the abdominal aorta of syngeneic Lewis rats. HW was generated by immersing a magnesium stick in tap water (Mg + 2H(2)O → Mg (OH)(2) + H(2)). Beginning on the day of graft implantation, recipients were given tap water [regular water (RW)], HW or HW that had been subsequently degassed water (DW). Six weeks after grafting, the grafts in the rats given RW or DW had developed intimal hyperplasia, accompanied by increased oxidative injury. HW significantly suppressed intimal hyperplasia. One week after grafting, the grafts in HW-treated rats exhibited improved endothelial integrity with less platelet and white blood cell aggregation. Up-regulation of the mRNAs for intracellular adhesion molecules was attenuated in the vein grafts of the rats receiving HW. Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 was also significantly inhibited in grafts receiving HW. In rat smooth muscle cell (A7r5) cultures, hydrogen treatment for 24 h reduced smooth muscle cell migration. Conclusion: Drinking HW significantly reduced neointima formation after vein grafting in rats. Drinking HW may have therapeutic value as a novel therapy for intimal hyperplasia and could easily be incorporated into daily life.

We investigated the protective effects and mechanism of hydrogen-rich saline in a glutamate-induced retinal injury model. Retinal excitotoxicity was induced in healthy guinea pigs by injecting glutamate into the vitreous cavity. After 30 min, hydrogen-rich saline was injected into the vitreous cavity, the peritoneal cavity or both. Seven days later, the retinal stress response was evaluated by examining the stress biomarkers, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). The impaired glutamate uptake was assessed by the expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter 1(EAAT-1). The retinal histopathological changes were investigated, focusing on the thicknesses of the entire retina and its inner layer, the number of cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the ultrastructure of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and glial cells. Compared with the glutamate-induced injury group, the hydrogen-rich saline treatment reduced the loss of cells in the GCL and thinning of the retina and attenuated cellular morphological damage.

This study aimed at examining the protective effect of H(2) saline on diabetic retinopathy in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model. Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into 3 groups as follows: (1) nondiabetic control group (non-DM control); (2) diabetic control group (DM control); and (3) diabetic rats receiving H(2) saline therapy (DM H(2) saline). Rats in DM H(2) saline group were intraperitoneally injected with H(2) saturated saline (5 mL/kg) every day for 4 weeks. Retinal vascular permeability was assessed by measuring Evans blue leakage into the retina. Retinal apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and measuring caspase-3 activity. Retinal thickness was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Our results showed that H(2) saline treatment could depress the caspase activity, reduce the retinal apoptosis, and vascular permeability. The H(2) saline could also prominently attenuate the retinal parenchyma thickening that resulted from diabetic retinopathy.

Recently, our and other studies have found that hydrogen gas (H₂) treatment can ameliorate the lung injury induced by sepsis, ventilator, hyperoxia, and ischemia-reperfusion. However, the molecular mechanisms by which H₂ ameliorates lung injury remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated whether H₂ or hydrogen-rich saline (HS) could exert protective effects in a mouse model of ALI induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via inhibiting the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway-mediated inflammation and apoptosis. Two percent of H₂ was inhaled for 1 h beginning at 1 and 6 h after LPS administration, respectively. We found that LPS-challenged mice exhibited significant lung injury characterized by the deterioration of histopathology and histologic scores, wet-to-dry weight ratio, and oxygenation index (PaO₂/FIO₂), as well as total protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which was attenuated by H₂ treatment. Hydrogen gas treatment inhibited LPS-induced pulmonary early and late NF-κB activation. Moreover, H₂ treatment dramatically prevented the LPS-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in LPS-challenged mice, as reflected by the decrease in TUNEL (deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) staining-positive cells and caspase 3 activity. Furthermore, H₂ treatment markedly attenuated LPS-induced lung neutrophil recruitment and inflammation, as evidenced by downregulation of lung myeloperoxidase activity, total cells, and polymorphonuclear neutrophils in BALF, as well as proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and high-mobility group box 1) and chemokines (keratinocyte-derived chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP] 1α, MIP-2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) in BALF. In addition, i.p. injection of 10 mL/kg hydrogen-rich saline also significantly attenuated the LPS-induced ALI. Collectively, these results demonstrate that molecular hydrogen treatment ameliorates LPS-induced ALI through reducing lung inflammation and apoptosis, which may be associated with the decreased NF-κB activity.

Some studies have found that hyperoxia may be beneficial to sepsis. However, the clinical use of hyperoxia is hindered by concerns that it could exacerbate organ injury by increasing free radical formation. Recently, it has been suggested that molecular hydrogen (H2) at low concentration can exert a therapeutic antioxidant activity and effectively protect against sepsis by reducing oxidative stress. Therefore, we hypothesized that combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia might afford more potent therapeutic strategies for sepsis. In the present study, we found that inhalation of H2 (2%) or hyperoxia (98%) alone improved the 14-day survival rate of septic mice with moderate cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) from 40% to 80% or 70%, respectively. However, combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia could increase the 14-day survival rate of moderate CLP mice to 100% and improve the 7-day survival rate of severe CLP mice from 0% to 70%. Moreover, moderate CLP mice showed significant organ damage characterized by the increases in lung myeloperoxidase activity, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage, serum biochemical parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen), and organ histopathological scores (lung, liver, and kidney), as well as the decrease in PaO2/FIO2 ratio at 24 h, which was attenuated by either H2 or hyperoxia alone. However, combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia had a more beneficial effect against lung, liver, and kidney damage of moderate or severe CLP mice. Furthermore, we found that the beneficial effect of this combination therapy was associated with the decreased levels of oxidative product (8-iso-prostaglandin F2α), increased activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin 10), and reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines (high-mobility group box 1 and tumor necrosis factor α) in serum and tissues. Therefore, combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia provides enhanced therapeutic efficacy via both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms and might be potentially a clinically feasible approach for sepsis.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) has been shown in recent studies to have potential as a safe and effective radioprotective agent through scavenging free radicals. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that H2 could protect immunocytes from ionizing radiation (IR). Material/methods: H2 was dissolved in physiological saline or medium using an apparatus produced by our department. A 2-[6-(4'-hydroxy) phenoxy-3H-xanthen-3-on-9-yl] benzoate (HPF) probe was used to detect intracellular hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Cell apoptosis was evaluated by annexin V-FITC and Propidium iodide (PI) staining as well as the caspase 3 activity. Finally, we examined the hematological changes using an automatic Sysmex XE 2100 hematology analyzer. Results: We demonstrated H2-rich medium pretreatment reduced •OH level in AHH-1 cells. We also showed H2 reduced radiation-induced apoptosis in thymocytes and splenocytes in living mice. Radiation-induced caspase 3 activation was also attenuated by H2 treatment. Finally, we found that H2 rescued the radiation-caused depletion of white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (PLT).

We investigated whether opening of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels (mK(ATP)) and subsequent inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP) mediates the infarct size-limiting effect of H(2) gas in canine hearts. The left anterior descending coronary artery of beagle dogs was occluded for 90 min followed by reperfusion for 6 h.

Systemic hemodynamic parameters did not differ among the groups. Nevertheless, H(2) gas inhalation reduced infarct size normalized by risk area (20.6±2.8% vs. control gas 44.0±2.0%; p<0.001), and administration of either 5-HD or Atr abolished the infarct size-limiting effect of H(2) gas (42.0±2.2% with 5-HD and 45.1±2.7% with Atr; both p<0.001 vs. H(2) group). Neither Atr nor 5-HD affected infarct size per se.

In the current study, we explored the effect of chronic treatment with hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) on left ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The 8-week-old male SHR and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were randomized into HRS-treated (6 ml/kg/day for 3 months, i.p.) and vehicle-treated groups.

The present study was performed to investigate the effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) on oxidative stress in the brain, cognitive dysfunction, and mortality in a rat model of sepsis. Methods: A rat model of sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. Physiologic saline or HRS was administered intraperitoneally (2.5 mL/kg or 10 mL/kg) 10 min before the operation. The survival rate was recorded, and cognitive function was tested using the Morris water maze. The reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase activity in the hippocampus were observed to evaluate the oxidative stress levels. The caspase 3 levels were measured to detect apoptosis. The histopathologic changes in the hippocampus were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay. Results: Cecal ligation and puncture resulted in a poor survival rate, evidence of brain injury, and cognitive dysfunction. The hippocampal reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels increased significantly, and superoxide dismutase activity decreased significantly. HRS reversed these changes in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: These findings indicate that HRS could attenuate the consequences of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture in rats, at least in part, by the inhibition of oxidative stress.

Forty guinea pigs were assigned to one of four groups: HS+NOISE (i.p. injection hydrogen-rich saline), NS+NOISE (i.p. injection normal saline), NOISE ALONE (noise control), and NO TREATMENT (normal control) groups. The HS+NOISE, NS+NOISE, and NOISE ALONE groups were exposed to intensive noise (4 h at 115 dB SPL noise of 4000±100 Hz). The auditory brainstem response (ABR) was used to examine the hearing threshold in each group. Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) was used to examine outer hair cell function. We also examined cochlear morphology to evaluate inner and outer hair cell trauma induced by noise exposure. Hydrogen-rich saline was administered twice daily for 6 days (2.5 ml/kg, i.p.) 24 h after noise exposure. Baseline ABR thresholds and DPOAE values were normal in all groups at the measured frequencies (2, 4, 8, and 16 kHz) before noise exposure. The ABR threshold shift was 50-55 dB across the frequencies tested, and average DPOAE declined in the NOISE ALONE, NS+NOISE, and HS+NOISE groups 24 h after noise exposure. However, the changes in cochlear parameters were different between groups. The HS+NOISE group showed a significantly decreased ABR threshold value as compared with the NS+NOISE or NOISE ALONE group (P<0.01) on day 7.

The present study aimed to examine the effect of hydrogen, a mild and selective cytotoxic oxygen radical scavenger, on oxidative stress injury, brain edema and neurology outcome following experimental SAH in rabbits. Results: The level of MDA, caspase-12/3 and brain water content increased significantly at 72 hours after experimental SAH. Correspondingly, obvious brain injury was found in the SAH group by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and Nissl staining. Similar results were found in the SAH+saline group. In contrast, the upregulated level of MDA, caspase-12/3 and brain edema was attenuated and the brain injury was substantially alleviated in the hydrogen treated rabbits, but the improvement of neurology outcome was not obvious. Conclusion: The results suggest that treatment with hydrogen in experimental SAH rabbits could alleviate brain injury via decreasing the oxidative stress injury and brain edema. Hence, we conclude that hydrogen possesses the potential to be a novel therapeutic agent for EBI after SAH.

The RW-culture medium significantly depressed TNF-α-enhanced endothelial H(2)O(2) production; improved CX3CL1, ICAM-1, and p53 expression; and inhibited activated monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells as well as to the CX3CL1 or the ICAM-1 coated plate when compared with the distilled-water-culture medium. In the in vivo study, the time required for FeCl(3)-induced occlusion in the urethane anesthetized rat's carotid and femoral arteries was significantly extended by intravenous RW saline infusion compared with distilled-water saline. FeCl(3) stimulation significantly enhanced vascular NADPH oxidase activity, ROS production, as well as CX3CL1, ICAM-1, p53, 3-nitrotyrosine, and 4-hydroxynonenal expression in the damaged arteries. Intravenous RW saline significantly reduced all the FeCl(3)-enhanced oxidative parameters when compared with intravenous distilled-water-saline infusion. We conclude that the RW-culture medium and saline made from magnesium alloy confer cardiovascular protection by the antioxidant capability.

The study was designed to determine the effect of hydrogen-rich saline on the smooth muscle contractile response to KCl, and on epithelial proliferation and apoptosis of intestine subjected to I/R. Methods: Intestinal I/R injury was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using bulldog clamps in superior mesenteric artery by 45 min ischemia followed by 1 h reperfusion. Rats were divided randomly into four groups: sham-operated, I/R, I/R plus saline treatment, and I/R plus hydrogen-rich saline treatment groups. Hydrogen-rich saline (>0.6 mM, 6 mL/kg) or saline (6 mL/kg) was administered, respectively, via tail vein 30 min prior to reperfusion. Following reperfusion, segments of terminal jejunum were rapidly taken and transferred into isolated organ bath and responses to KCl were recorded. Samples of terminal jejunum were also taken for measuring malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase. Apoptosis in intestinal epithelium was determined with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling technique (TUNEL). Expression and distribution of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were detected with immunohistochemistry. Results: Hydrogen-rich saline treatment significantly attenuated the severity of intestinal I/R injury, with inhibiting of I/R-induced apoptosis, and promoting enterocytes proliferation. Moreover, Hydrogen-rich saline treatment significantly limited the neutrophil infiltration, lipid oxidation, and ameliorated the decreased contractility response to KCl in the intestine subjected to I/R. Conclusions: These results suggest that hydrogen treatment has a protective effect against intestinal contractile dysfunction and damage induced by intestinal I/R. This protective effect is possibly due to its ability to inhibit I/R-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and to promote epithelial cell proliferation.",Positive,Rat,Intestine,Intestinal Injury,Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) Injury,Saline (Dissolved),Neutral,Injection,,,China

The present study was designed to examine the underlying radioprotective mechanism of H2 and its protective role on irradiated germ cells. Produced by the Fenton reaction and radiolysis of H2O, hydroxyl radicals (•OH) were identified as the free radical species that were reduced by H2. We used a H2 microelectrode to dynamically detect H2 concentration in vivo, and found H2 significantly reduced in situ fluorescence intensity of hydroxyphenyl fluorescein; however, as we treated the mice with H2 after irradiation, the decrease is not significant. We found that pre-treatment of H2 to IR (ionizing radiation) significantly suppressed the reaction of •OH and the cellular macromolecules which caused lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl and oxidatively damaged DNA.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether hydrogen protects against severe burn-induced acute lung injury in rats. Rats were divided into four groups: sham plus normal saline, burn injury plus normal saline, burn injury plus hydrogen-rich saline, and burn injury plus edaravone. Animals were given full-thickness burn wounds (30% TBSA) using boiling water, except the sham group that was treated with room temperature water. The rats in hydrogen group received 5 ml/kg of hydrogen-rich saline, sham and burn controls obtained the same amount of saline, and the edaravone group was treated with 9 mg/kg of edaravone in saline. Lactated Ringer's solution was given at 6 hours postburn. The lungs were harvested 12 hours postburn for laboratory investigations. Severe burns with delayed resuscitation rapidly caused lung edema and impaired oxygenation in rats. These dysfunctions were ameliorated by administration of hydrogen-rich saline or edaravone. When compared with the burn injury plus normal saline group, hydrogen-rich saline or edaravone group significantly attenuated the pulmonary oxidative products, such as malondialdehyde, carbonyl, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Furthermore, administration of hydrogen-rich saline or edaravone dramatically reduced the pulmonary levels of pulmonary inflammation mediators and myeloperoxidase.

Female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: (1) the control (CONT); (2) the Hindlimb unloading (HU, for 3 weeks) given purified normal water (HU-NW); (3) the HU given alkaline electrolyzed reduced water (HU-AEW); and (4) the HU given HSW (HU-HSW). We showed that 8-OHdG, but not MDA, significantly increased by 149% and 145% in HU-NW and HU-AEW, respectively, when compared with CONT. In contrast, there was a trend toward suppression in 8-OHdG levels (increased by 95% compared with CONT) by treatment of HSW, though this effect was not prominent. Additionally, SOD-like activity significantly increased in both HU-NW (184%) and HU-AEW (199%) when compared with CONT. This result suggests the elevation of O2-· in the atrophied gastrocnemius. However, upregulation of SOD-like activity in the HU-HSW was increased by only 169% compared with CONT, though this difference is too small to detect statistical significance. HU led to 13% and 15% reduction of gastrocnemius wet weights in HU-NW and HU-AEW, respectively, compared with CONT. And the reduction of gastrocnemius wet weights in HU-HSW was attenuated by 7% compared with CONT. The gastrocnemius wet weights in the HU-HSW group were significantly greater than those in the HU-AEW, but not statistically significant with HU-NW. These results indicate that HU causes an increase in oxidative stress, but, in this experimental protocol, continuous consumption of HSW during HU does not demonstrate successful attenuation of oxidative stress and HU-mediated gastrocnemius atrophy.

H2 directly reacts with the strong reactive nitrogen species peroxynitrite (ONOO-) as well as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), but not with nitric oxide radical (NO•). We hypothesized that one of the H2 functions is caused by reducing cellular ONOO-, which is generated by the rapid reaction of NO• with superoxides (•O2-). To verify this hypothesis, we examined whether H2 could restore cytotoxicity and transcriptional alterations induced by ONOO- derived from NO• in chondrocytes. Methods: We treated cultured chondrocytes from porcine hindlimb cartilage or from rat meniscus fibrecartilage with a donor of NO•, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) in the presence or absence of H2. Chondrocyte viability was determined using a LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit. Gene expressions of the matrix proteins of cartilage and the matrix metalloproteinases were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-coupled real-time PCR method. Results: SNAP treatment increased the levels of nitrated proteins. H2 decreased the levels of the nitrated proteins, and suppressed chondrocyte death. It is known that the matrix proteins of cartilage (including aggrecan and type II collagen) and matrix metalloproteinases (such as MMP3 and MMP13) are down- and up-regulated by ONOO-, respectively. H2 restoratively increased the gene expressions of aggrecan and type II collagen in the presence of H2. Conversely, the gene expressions of MMP3 and MMP13 were restoratively down-regulated with H2. Thus, H2 acted to restore transcriptional alterations induced by ONOO-. Conclusions: These results imply that one of the functions of H2 exhibits cytoprotective effects and transcriptional alterations through reducing ONOO-. Moreover, novel pharmacological strategies aimed at selective removal of ONOO- may represent a powerful method for preventive and therapeutic use of H2 for joint diseases.

Therefore, we investigated whether hydrogen-rich water (HRW) affects metabolic abnormalities in the metabolic syndrome rat model, SHR.Cg-Leprcp/NDmcr (SHR-cp). Male SHR-cp rats (5 weeks old) were divided into 2 groups: an HRW group was given oral HRW for 16 weeks, and a control group was given distilled water. At the end of the experiment, each rat was placed in a metabolic cage for 24 h, fasted for 12 h, and anesthetized; the blood and kidneys were then collected. Sixteen weeks after HRW administration, the water intake and urine flow measured in the metabolic cages were significantly higher in the HRW group than in the control group. The urinary ratio of albumin to creatinine was significantly lower and creatinine clearance was higher in the HRW group than in the control group. After the 12-h fast, plasma urea nitrogen and creatinine in the HRW group were significantly lower than in the control group. The plasma total antioxidant capacity was significantly higher in the HRW group than in the control group. The glomerulosclerosis score for the HRW group was significantly lower than in the control group, and a significantly positive correlation was observed between this score and plasma urea nitrogen levels.

We previously reported that intermittent hypoxia increases superoxide production in a manner dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and accelerates adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling.

In this study, we investigated the effects of H(2) gas inhalation on lipid metabolism and LV remodeling induced by intermittent hypoxia in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice (n = 62) were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (repetitive cycle of 1-min periods of 5 and 21% oxygen for 8 h during daytime) for 7 days. H(2) gas (1.3 vol/100 vol) was given either at the time of reoxygenation, during hypoxic conditions, or throughout the experimental period. Mice kept under normoxic conditions served as controls (n = 13). Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased plasma levels of low- and very low-density cholesterol and the amount of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified protein adducts in the LV myocardium. It also upregulated mRNA expression of tissue necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and brain natriuretic peptide, increased production of superoxide, and induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, nuclear deformity, mitochondrial degeneration, and interstitial fibrosis. H(2) gas inhalation significantly suppressed these changes induced by intermittent hypoxia. In particular, H(2) gas inhaled at the timing of reoxygenation or throughout the experiment was effective in preventing dyslipidemia and suppressing superoxide production in the LV myocardium.

In addition, hydrogen effects on humans have been reported in diabetes mellitus type 2, hemodialysis, metabolic syndrome, radiotherapy for liver cancer, and brain stem infarction. Hydrogen effects are ascribed to specific radical-scavenging activities that eliminate hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite, and also to signal-modulating activities, but the detailed molecular mechanisms still remain elusive. Hydrogen is a safe molecule that is largely produced by intestinal bacteria in rodents and humans, and no adverse effects have been documented. Methods: We performed open-label trial of drinking 1.0 liter per day of hydrogen-enriched water for 12 weeks in five patients with progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD), four patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), and five patients with mitochondrial myopathies (MM), and measured 18 serum parameters as well as urinary 8-isoprostane every 4 weeks. We next conducted randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 0.5 liter per day of hydrogen-enriched water or placebo water for 8 weeks in 10 patients with DM and 12 patients with MM, and measured 18 serum parameters every 4 weeks. Results: In the open-label trial, no objective improvement or worsening of clinical symptoms was observed. We, however, observed significant effects in lactate-to-pyruvate ratios in PMD and MM, fasting blood glucose in PMD, serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) in PM/DM, and serum triglycerides in PM/DM. In the double-blind trial, no objective clinical effects were observed, but a significant improvement was detected in lactate in MM. Lactate-to-pyruvate ratios in MM and MMP3 in DM also exhibited favorable responses but without statistical significance. No adverse effect was observed in either trial except for hypoglycemic episodes in an insulin-treated MELAS patient, which subsided by reducing the insulin dose. Conclusions: Hydrogen-enriched water improves mitochondrial dysfunction in MM and inflammatory processes in PM/DM. Less prominent effects with the double-blind trial compared to the open-label trial were likely due to a lower amount of administered hydrogen and a shorter observation period, which implies a threshold effect or a dose-response effect of hydrogen.

However, we have recently demonstrated that hydrogen inhibits type I allergy through modulating intracellular signal transduction. In the present study, we examined the hydrogen effects on lipopolysaccharide/interferon γ LPS/IFNγ-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in murine macrophage RAW264 cells. Treatment with hydrogen reduced LPS/IFNγ-induced NO release, which was associated with a diminished induction of inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Hydrogen treatment inhibited LPS/IFNγ-induced phosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and its downstream signaling molecules, p38 MAP kinase and JNK, as well as IκBα, but did not affect activation of NADPH oxidase and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As ROS is an upstream activator of ASK1, inhibition of ASK1 by hydrogen without suppressing ROS implies that a potential target molecule of hydrogen should be located at the receptor or immediately downstream of it. These results suggested a role for molecular hydrogen as a signal modulator. Finally, oral intake of hydrogen-rich water alleviated anti-type II collagen antibody-induced arthritis in mice, a model for human rheumatoid arthritis.

Also, changes in the intraluminal pressures were monitored before and after the gas infusions. Key results: Methane decreased peristaltic velocity and increased contraction amplitude significantly of guinea pig ileum (P < 0.05). The AUC of intraluminal pressure was significantly increased with methane in guinea pig ileum (P < 0.05). In a second experiment, guinea pig colon was placed in the peristaltic bath to measure transit time before and after control, hydrogen, methane, and methane-hydrogen mixture gas infusions. Hydrogen shortened colonic transit time by 47% in the proximal colon, and by 10% in the distal colon, when compared with baselines (P < 0.05). Conclusions & inferences: Methane delayed ileal peristaltic conduction velocity by augmenting contractility. Hydrogen shortened colonic transit, and that effect was more prominent in the proximal colon than distal colon.",Positive,Guinea Pig,Intestine,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),Constipation,Gas,N/A,In Vivo Biotic Production,Methane,,South Korea

In this study, we tested the protective effect of hydrogen-rich saline on the brain in a global cerebral I/R model. Materials and methods: We used a four-vessel occlusion model of global cerebral ischemia (15 min) and reperfusion with rats. The rats were divided into four groups (n = 96): sham, I/R plus physiologic saline injected intraperitoneally, I/R plus hydrogen-rich saline injected intraperitoneally at the beginning of reperfusion, and I/R plus hydrogen-rich saline injected intraperitoneally 6 h after reperfusion began. One group of rats was sacrificed after 24 h of reperfusion. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured to quantify the oxidative stress. Caspase-3 was measured to indicate the status of apoptosis. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were measured to monitor the inflammation. Another group of rats was sacrificed after 72 h of reperfusion to measure the histologic damages in hippocampus by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Nissl staining. Results: Compared with rats with I/R only, hydrogen-rich saline treatment significantly improved the amount of surviving cells. NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, MDA, and caspase-3 were all increased significantly by I/R injury. Hydrogen-rich saline reduced all these markers. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that intraperitoneal injection of hydrogen-rich saline has strong protective effect on the transient global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats.

First, we show that hepatic glycogen accumulates H(2) after oral administration of H(2)-water, explaining why consumption of even a small amount of H(2) over a short span time efficiently improves various disease models. This finding was supported by an in vitro experiment in which glycogen solution maintained H(2). Next, we examined the benefit of ad libitum drinking H(2)-water to type 2 diabetes using db/db obesity model mice lacking the functional leptin receptor. Drinking H(2)-water reduced hepatic oxidative stress, and significantly alleviated fatty liver in db/db mice as well as high fat-diet-induced fatty liver in wild-type mice. Long-term drinking H(2)-water significantly controlled fat and body weights, despite no increase in consumption of diet and water. Moreover, drinking H(2)-water decreased levels of plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride, the effect of which on hyperglycemia was similar to diet restriction. To examine how drinking H(2)-water improves obesity and metabolic parameters at the molecular level, we examined gene-expression profiles, and found enhanced expression of a hepatic hormone, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which functions to enhance fatty acid and glucose expenditure. Indeed, H(2) stimulated energy metabolism as measured by oxygen consumption. The present results suggest the potential benefit of H(2) in improving obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

Many side effects of radiotherapy are believed to be associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation due to the generation of reactive oxygen species during radiotherapy. Hydrogen can be administered as a therapeutic medical gas, has antioxidant properties, and reduces inflammation in tissues. This study examined whether hydrogen treatment, in the form of hydrogen-supplemented water, improved QOL in patients receiving radiotherapy. Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled study was performed to evaluate the effects of drinking hydrogen-rich water on 49 patients receiving radiotherapy for malignant liver tumors. Hydrogen-rich water was produced by placing a metallic magnesium stick into drinking water (final hydrogen concentration; 0.55~0.65 mM). The Korean version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's QLQ-C30 instrument was used to evaluate global health status and QOL. The concentration of derivatives of reactive oxidative metabolites and biological antioxidant power in the peripheral blood were assessed. Results: The consumption of hydrogen-rich water for 6 weeks reduced reactive oxygen metabolites in the blood and maintained blood oxidation potential. QOL scores during radiotherapy were significantly improved in patients treated with hydrogen-rich water compared to patients receiving placebo water. There was no difference in tumor response to radiotherapy between the two groups. Conclusions: Daily consumption of hydrogen-rich water is a potentially novel, therapeutic strategy for improving QOL after radiation exposure. Consumption of hydrogen-rich water reduces the biological reaction to radiation-induced oxidative stress without compromising anti-tumor effects.

As molecular hydrogen can act as a scavenger of ROS, we examined the effects of treatment with hydrogen-rich water on a rat model of periodontitis.

The rats with periodontitis which were treated with pure water showed a time-dependent increase in serum ROS level. Compared with the rats without periodontitis, the periodontitis-induced rats which were given pure water also showed polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration and alveolar bone loss at 4 weeks. Hydrogen-rich water intake inhibited an increase in serum ROS level and lowered expression of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and nitrotyrosine in the periodontal tissue at 4 weeks. Such conditions prevented polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration and osteoclast differentiation following periodontitis progression. Furthermore, inflammatory signalling pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases, were less activated in periodontal lesions from hydrogen-rich water-treated rats as compared with pure water-treated rats.

The denture was immersed in the e-WASH solution (experimental group), or tap water (control group) for 5 minutes. The plaque was collected from the denture surface before and after immersion, and smeared on the slide glass. Amount and motility of microorganisms were compared according to the morphology and strain of microorganisms, using the phase contrast microscope. Statistical analysis was accomplished with paired t-test and independent t-test at 95% confidence level (P<.05). Results: 1. The amount of cocci, bacilli, filamentous, spiral/comma, and the motility of bacilli, filamentous, and spiral/comma were decreased after denture cleansing with the alkaline ionized water, e-WASH (P<.05). But in the control group, only the amount of cocci showed a significant difference (P<.05), but no difference from the others. There were no differences in other analysis. 2. In the experimental group, the amount of cocci, bacilli, filamentous, spiral/comma, and the motility of bacilli, filamentous, and spiral/comma were smaller and more inactive compared to the control group (P<.05). Conclusion: These results indicated that the alkaline ionized water, e-WASH could effectively reduce the amount and motility of the experimented microorganisms on the denture surface, and that e-WASH could be recommended as an effective denture cleanser.

Materials and methods: We acquired T(2)*-weighted images (T(2)*WI) of 21 rats on Days 0, 2, 4, and 7 using a 1.5-tesla MR imaging system. The rats were divided into 3 groups of seven each: control rats had free access to standard water and no gentamicin (GM) injection; rats designated the GM group had free access to standard water and were injected with GM (80 mg/kg/day) subcutaneously for 7 days; and the third group, designated the GM+HW group, had free access to HW and were injected with GM. R(2)* (=1/T(2)*) was estimated from T(2)*WI. Results: R(2)* values in the cortex were significantly decreased on Days 2, 4, and 7 compared with those on Day 0 in the GM group but not significantly changed in the control and GM+HW groups. R(2)* values in the medulla did not change significantly in any group. Conclusions: Our findings suggested reduced oxygen utility, mainly in the cortex, in gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity and an ameliorative effect of hydrogen-rich water against GIN.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a control (C) diet, with or without Pec (0-5 % Pec) or HAS (0-30 % HAS) supplementation for 7 d. Portal H2 concentration showed a significant dose-dependent increase with the amount of Pec or HAS supplementation. Plasma alanine and aspartate aminotransferase activities remarkably increased in the C rats (5 % cellulose) due to IR treatment, while it decreased significantly or showed tendencies to decrease in 5 % Pec and 20 % HAS diet-fed rats. The hepatic oxidised glutathione (GSSG):total glutathione ratio increased significantly in IR rats maintained on the C diet compared with sham-operated rats.

A non-controlled study",2011,Medical Gas Research,10.1186/2045-9912-1-12,"In acute stage of cerebral infarction, MRI indices (rDWI & rADC) deteriorate during the first 3-7 days after the ictus and then gradually normalize in approximately 10 days (pseudonormalization time), although the tissue is already infarcted. Since effective treatments improve these indices significantly and in less than the natural pseudonormalization time, a combined analysis of these changes provides an opportunity for objective evaluation on the effectiveness of various treatments for cerebral infarction. Hydroxyl radicals are highly destructive to the tissue and aggravate cerebral infarction. We treated brainstem infarction patients in acute stage with hydroxyl radical scavengers (Edaravone and hydrogen) by intravenous administration and evaluated the effects of the treatment by a serial observation and analysis of these MRI indices. The effects of the treatment were evaluated and compared in two groups, an Edaravone alone group and a combined group with Edaravone and hydrogen, in order to assess beneficial effects of addition of hydrogen.

Mice were randomized into three groups: sham group (physiological saline+2% hydrogen mixed gas), control group (LPS+normal air) and experiment group (LPS+2% hydrogen mixed gas). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed to determine the total protein concentrations and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Lung tissues were assayed for oxidative stress variables, wet/dry (W/D) ratio, histological, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting examinations. Our experiments exhibited that hydrogen improved the survival rate of mice and induced a decrease in lung W/D ratio. In addition, hydrogen decreased malonaldehyde and nitrotyrosine content, inhibited myeloperoxidase and maintained superoxide dismutase activity in lung tissues and associated with a decrease in the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and total protein concentrations in the BALF. Hydrogen further attenuated histopathological alterations and mitigated lung cell apoptosis. Importantly, hydrogen inhibited the activation of P-JNK, and also reversed changes in Bax, Bcl-xl and caspase-3. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that hydrogen inhalation ameliorated LPS-induced ALI and it may be exerting its protective role by preventing the activation of ROS-JNK-caspase-3 pathway.

Design: Controlled animal study. Setting: University research laboratory for Diving Medicine. Subjects: Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 ± 20 g. Interventions: The rats were exposed to 1000 ppm CO in air for 40 min and then to 3000 ppm for another 20 min until they lost consciousness. Rats were intraperitoneal injected with hydrogen-rich saline or normal saline (10 mL/kg) for six times after resuscitation at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hrs, respectively. The rats without CO poisoning were used as normal controls. Measurements and main results: Brain tissue inflammation, cell death, and cognitive dysfunction were observed at one week after CO poisoning. Hydrogen-rich saline treatment significantly reduced the level of degraded myelin basic protein, decreased the expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, Iba1, a microglial marker, reduced DNA oxidation, and suppressed proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the cortex and hippocampal tissues when compared with those in normal saline-treated rats. These histologic and biological improvements were accompanied with an improvement in the Morris water maze test. Conclusions: This observation demonstrated that hydrogen-rich saline peritoneal injection improves histologic and functional assessment in a rat model of CO encephalopathy. Hydrogen saline has potentials as a novel and alternative therapy for severely CO-poisoned patients with delayed neurologic sequelae.

In our previous study in coral calcium hydride (CCH), we reported that a diet rich in antioxidants inhibited the pathologic aging process, increased the endogenous antioxidant ability, and contributed to prolonging the lifespan of SAM/P-8. To test the hypothesis that antioxidant CCH supplementation to SAM/P-8 mice would change the gene expression and to understand how CCH reverses the acceleration of aging in SAM/P-8 mice, we used a DNA array to compare the expression levels in the hippocampus of the brains from 16-week-old SAM/P-8 mice that were either treated or not treated with CCH. The most significant up-regulated changes in the gene network of SAM/P-8 mice were free radical scavenging and molecular transport, whereas genes associated with cell death, cancer, and cell cycle were down-regulated. Our findings regarding the changes in these messenger RNA might be associated with the inhibition of the acceleration of aging, as observed in SAM/P-8 mice fed a CCH diet.

However there is no study about beneficial effects of ERW bathing. This study aimed to determine the effect of ERW bathing on the UVB-induced skin injury in hairless mice. For this purpose, mice were irradiated with UVB to cause skin injury, followed by individually taken a bath in ERW (ERW-bathing) and tap water (TW-bathing) for 21 d. We examined cytokines profile in acute period, and histological and ultrastructural observation of skin in chronic period. We found that UVB-mediated skin injury of ERW-bathing group was significantly low compared to TW control group in the early stage of experiment. Consistently, epidermal thickening as well as the number of dermal mast cell was significantly lowered in ERW-bathing group. Defection of corneocytes under the scanning electron microscope was less observed in ERW-bathing group than in TW-bathing group. Further, the level of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-12p70 in ERW group decreased whereas those of IL-10 increased. Collectively, our data indicate that ERW-bathing significantly reduces UVB-induced skin damage through influencing pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance in hairless mice.

Methods: Thirty PQ poisoned rats were randomly divided into a PQ intoxication group (intoxication group), a saturated hydrogen saline intervention group (intervention group), and a control group, with 10 rats in each group. The first two groups accepted an intragastric administration of PQ at a dose of 50 mg/kg for every single rat, and the control group was fed with a same volume of normal saline. Five mL/kg of saturated hydrogen saline was given to the intervention group three times a day by peritoneal injection for three days after intoxication.

Anesthetized, ventilated piglets were assigned to one of the following groups: A/R with RA or H2-RA ventilation (A/R-RA and A/R-H2-RA; n = 8 and 7, respectively) and respective time control groups (n = 9 and 7). Asphyxia was induced by suspending ventilation for 10 min, followed by reventilation with the respective gases for 4 h. After euthanasia, the brains were processed for neuropathological examination. Pial arteriolar diameter changes to graded hypercapnia (5-10% CO2 inhalation), and NMDA (10(-4) M) were determined using the closed cranial window/intravital microscopy before and 1 h after asphyxia. Neuropathology revealed that H2-RA ventilation significantly reduced neuronal injury induced by A/R in virtually all examined brain regions including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and the brainstem.

Inhaled hydrogen can act as an antioxidant and may be useful as a novel therapeutic gas. We hypothesized that, owing to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, inhaled hydrogen therapy could ameliorate VILI. VILI was generated in male C57BL6 mice by performing a tracheostomy and placing the mice on a mechanical ventilator (tidal volume of 30 ml/kg without positive end-expiratory pressure, FiO(2) 0.21). The mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups and subjected to VILI with delivery of either 2% nitrogen or 2% hydrogen in air. Sham animals were given same gas treatments for two hours (n = 8 for each group). The effects of VILI induced by less invasive and longer exposure to MV (tidal volume of 10 ml/kg, 5 hours, FiO(2) 0.21) were also investigated (n = 6 for each group). Lung injury score, wet/dry ratio, arterial oxygen tension, oxidative injury, and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and apoptotic genes were assessed at the endpoint of two hours using the high-tidal volume protocol. Gas exchange and apoptosis were assessed at the endpoint of five hours using the low-tidal volume protocol. Ventilation (30 ml/kg) with 2% nitrogen in air for 2 hours resulted in deterioration of lung function, increased lung edema, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In contrast, ventilation with 2% hydrogen in air significantly ameliorated these acute lung injuries. Hydrogen treatment significantly inhibited upregulation of the mRNAs for pro-inflammatory mediators and induced antiapoptotic genes. In the lungs treated with hydrogen, there was less malondialdehyde compared with lungs treated with nitrogen. Similarly, longer exposure to mechanical ventilation within lower tidal volume (10 mg/kg, five hours) caused lung injury including bronchial epithelial apoptosis. Hydrogen improved gas exchange and reduced VILI-induced apoptosis. Inhaled hydrogen gas effectively reduced VILI-associated inflammatory responses, at both a local and systemic level, via its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects.",Positive,Mouse,Lung,Surgery/Transplantation,Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,United States

Antioxidant electrolysed-reduced water (ERW) was used as the dialysate in ESRD patients undergoing chronic HD to test for improved oxidative stress-related T-cell apoptosis, alterations of surface markers and intracellular cytokine profile. Methods: We evaluated apoptosis formation by annexin V, CD25-related surface markers, and cytokine ratio of Th1/Th2 in CD4(+) T lymphocytes and Tc1/Tc2 in CD8(+) T lymphocytes of 42 ESRD patients haemodialysed with ERW for 1 year. Results: In comparison to 12 healthy individuals, the ESRD patients had more T-cell apoptosis and less CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and CD25/CD69/CD94/CD3(+) phenotypes at baseline. Lower intracellular IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels in the Th1/CD4(+) and Tc1/CD8(+) cells and higher intracellular IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 levels in the Th2/CD4(+) and Tc2/CD8(+) cells were also noted in the ESRD patients. After a 1-year ERW treatment, the patients had a decrease in T-cell apoptosis and increases in CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell numbers and CD25/CD69/CD94/CD3(+) phenotypes in the T cells. The intracellular IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels in the Th1/Tc1 cells significantly (P < 0.05) increased and the intracellular IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 levels in the Th2/Tc2 cells decreased. Furthermore, the Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 cytokine ratios were improved toward a normal status.

It has been shown that hydrogen gas (H(2)) exerts a therapeutic antioxidant activity by selectively reducing hydroxyl radical (OH, the most cytotoxic ROS). Recently, we have found that H(2) inhalation significantly improved the survival rate and organ damage of septic mice. In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of H(2) therapy on brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, neurological dysfunction and injury volume in TBI-challenged rats. In addition, we investigated the effects of H(2) treatment on the changes of oxidative products and antioxidant enzymes in brain tissue of TBI-challenged rats. Hydrogen treatment was given by exposure to 2% H(2) from 5 min to 5h after sham or TBI operation, respectively. Here, we found that TBI-challenged rats showed significant brain injuries characterized by the increase of BBB permeability, brain edema and lesion volume as well as neurological dysfunction, which was significantly attenuated by 2% H(2) treatment. In addition, we found that the decrease of oxidative products and the increase of endogenous antioxidant enzymatic activities in the brain tissue may be associated with the protective effects of H(2) treatment in TBI-challenged rats. The present study supports that H(2) inhalation may be a more effective therapeutic strategy for patients with TBI.

Hydrogen gas has potent antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties and has been recently used in number of experimental and clinical studies. The purpose of this research was to investigate whether inhaled hydrogen gas could reduce graft I/R injury during lung transplantation. Orthotopic left LTxs were performed in syngenic Lewis rats. Grafts were perfused with and stored in low potassium dextran solution at 4°C for 6 hr. The recipients received 100% O2 or 98% O2 with 2% N2, 2% He, or 2% H2 during surgery and 1 hr after reperfusion. The effects of hydrogen were assessed by functional, pathologic, and molecular analysis. Gas exchange was markedly impaired in animals exposed to 100% O2, 2% N2, or 2% He. Hydrogen inhalation attenuated graft injury as indicated by significantly improved gas exchange 2 hr after reperfusion. Graft lipid peroxidation was significantly reduced in the presence of hydrogen, demonstrating antioxidant effects of hydrogen in the transplanted lungs.

Low frequency of MSCs in adult bone marrow necessitates ex vivo expansion of MSCs after harvest; however, such a manipulation causes cellular senescence with loss of differentiation, proliferative, and therapeutic potentials of MSCs. Hydrogen molecules have been shown to exert organ protective effects through selective reduction of hydroxyl radicals. As oxidative stress is one of the key insults promoting cell senescence in vivo as well as in vitro, we hypothesized that hydrogen molecules prevent senescent process during MSC expansion. Addition of 3% hydrogen gas enhanced preservation of colony forming early progenitor cells within MSC preparation and prolonged the in vitro replicative lifespan of MSCs without losing differentiation potentials and paracrine capabilities.

Study results have indicated that molecular hydrogen (H(2)) is an efficient antioxidant gas that selectively reduces the hydroxyl radical (*OH) and suppresses oxidative stress-induced injury in several organs. This study was conducted to explore the neuroprotective effect of H(2)-loaded eye drops on retinal I/R injury. Methods: Retinal ischemia was induced in rats by raising IOP for 60 minutes. H(2)-loaded eye drops were prepared by dissolving H(2) gas into a saline to saturated level and administered to the ocular surface continuously during the ischemia and/or reperfusion periods. One day after I/R injury, apoptotic cells in the retina were quantified, and oxidative stress was evaluated by markers such as 4-hydroxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine. Seven days after I/R injury, retinal damage was quantified by measuring the thickness of the retina. Results: When H(2)-loaded eye drops were continuously administered, H(2) concentration in the vitreous body immediately increased and I/R-induced *OH level decreased. The drops reduced the number of retinal apoptotic and oxidative stress marker-positive cells and prevented retinal thinning with an accompanying activation of Müller glia, astrocytes, and microglia. The drops improved the recovery of retinal thickness by >70%. Conclusions: H(2) has no known toxic effects on the human body.

So, we aimed to assess its efficacy in the management of metabolic acidosis in animal models. Two models of metabolic acidosis were created in dogs and rats.

At day-7, DSS-induced pathogenic outcomes including, loss of body weight, increase of colitis score, pathogenic shortening of colon length, elevated level of IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in colon lesion, were significantly suppressed by the addition of H2 to DSS solution. Histological analysis also revealed that the DSS-mediated colonic tissue destruction accompanied by macrophage infiltration was remarkably suppressed by H2. Therefore, the present study indicated that H2 can prevent the development of DSS-induced colitis in mice.

Systemic antibiotics significantly decreased the level of H(2) in both liver and intestines along with suppression of intestinal bacteria. As determined by the levels of AST, ALT, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in serum, suppression of intestinal bacterial flora by antibiotics increased the severity of ConA-induced hepatitis, while reconstitution of intestinal flora with H(2)-producing E. coli, but not H(2)-deficient mutant E. coli, down-regulated the ConA-induced liver inflammation. Furthermore, in vitro production of both TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma by ConA-stimulated spleen lymphocytes was significantly inhibited by the introduction of H(2).

When water saturated with hydrogen (hydrogen water) was placed into the stomach of a rat, hydrogen was detected at several microM level in blood. Because hydrogen gas is unsuitable for continuous consumption, we investigated using mice whether drinking hydrogen water ad libitum, instead of inhaling hydrogen gas, prevents cognitive impairment by reducing oxidative stress. Chronic physical restraint stress to mice enhanced levels of oxidative stress markers, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, in the brain, and impaired learning and memory, as judged by three different methods: passive avoidance learning, object recognition task, and the Morris water maze. Consumption of hydrogen water ad libitum throughout the whole period suppressed the increase in the oxidative stress markers and prevented cognitive impairment, as judged by all three methods, whereas hydrogen water did not improve cognitive ability when no stress was provided. Neural proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was suppressed by restraint stress, as observed by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and Ki-67 immunostaining, proliferation markers. The consumption of hydrogen water ameliorated the reduced proliferation although the mechanistic link between the hydrogen-dependent changes in neurogenesis and cognitive impairments remains unclear. Thus, continuous consumption of hydrogen water reduces oxidative stress in the brain, and prevents the stress-induced decline in learning and memory caused by chronic physical restraint.

Methods: Dialysis solution with H(2) (average of 48 ppb) was produced by mixing dialysate concentrates and reverse osmosis water containing dissolved H(2) generated by a water electrolysis technique. Subjects comprised 21 stable patients on standard HD who were switched to the test HD for 6 months at three sessions a week. Results: During the study period, no adverse clinical signs or symptoms were observed. A significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) before and after dialysis was observed during the study, and a significant number of patients achieved SBP <140 mmHg after HD (baseline, 21%; 6 months, 62%; P < 0.05). Changes in dialysis parameters were minimal, while significant decreases in levels of plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (P < 0.01) and myeloperoxidase (P < 0.05) were identified.

The average age of the test persons is 71.5 years and the daily consumption of reduced water is as much as two liters. The average duration of stay in Nordenau is 6 days. The diagnostic parameters such as blood sugar, HbA1c, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and serum creatinine concentration are tested twice - at the beginning and at the end of the participants stay in Nordenau. Additionally a random sample of reactive oxygen species in the blood of 136 patients is taken in order to find out its possible causal connections to the diabetes relevant test parameters.HbA1c has been considered as the substantial test parameter in order to break down the whole group into responder and non-responder categories. One hundred and eighty six tested persons or 45% of the total have been assigned to the responder group, meaning that the patients’ HbA1c and blood sugar improved significantly. Furthermore we evaluated among the responder group a portion of patients who in the same time significantly improved their cholesterol, LDL, HDL and serum creatinine concentration average value. This stage of our follow up study regarding type II diabetes patients estimates number needed to treat on four patients in order to achieve the significant improvement of all diabetes relevant parameters. This is a very good quotient; moreover it could be achieved entirely without side effects. The significant improvement of diabetes relevant parameters like blood fats and creatinine can be also beneficial to other diseases like high blood pressure, circulatory disturbance, renal insufficiency or atherosclerotic dementia. In addition to our previous tests, we administered to a random sample group of 136 patients a blood free oxygen radicals test (FORT). The test resulted in a decrease of the ROS of 70.6% of the group or 96 patients. Taking account of the fact that the natural reduced water as well as the electrolyzed reduced water obviously improves in a very short time and entirely without side effects very important metabolic parameters, it can be said that the reduced water shall be considered a useful supplement to the usual orthodox medication of ROS-associated diseases.",Positive,Human,Whole Body,Diabetes (Type II),Oxidative Stress,"Water, Commercial (Nordenau)",Alkaline,Ingestion,,,Germany

It is well established that hydrogen has a reducing action. We therefore investigated the effects of hydrogen-rich water intake on lipid and glucose metabolism in patients with either type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 30 patients with T2DM controlled by diet and exercise therapy and 6 patients with IGT. The patients consumed either 900 mL/d of hydrogen-rich pure water or 900 mL of placebo pure water for 8 weeks, with a 12-week washout period. Several biomarkers of oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and glucose metabolism, assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test, were evaluated at baseline and at 8 weeks. Intake of hydrogen-rich water was associated with significant decreases in the levels of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (ie, modifications that increase the net negative charge of LDL), small dense LDL, and urinary 8-isoprostanes by 15.5% (P < .01), 5.7% (P < .05), and 6.6% (P < .05), respectively. Hydrogen-rich water intake was also associated with a trend of decreased serum concentrations of oxidized LDL and free fatty acids, and increased plasma levels of adiponectin and extracellular-superoxide dismutase. In 4 of 6 patients with IGT, intake of hydrogen-rich water normalized the oral glucose tolerance test.

The body weight of the MRW group was significantly lower than that of the control group in most periods of the examination (P<0.05). Serum level of triglycerides (P<0.05) and fat deposition in the livers of the MRW group were found to have been significantly reduced. This suggests that MRW down-regulates lipid metabolism, thereby suppressing obesity. Possible mechanisms of MRW related to reactive oxygen species were also discussed.

Both an increase in reactive oxygen free radical species (ROS) and a decrease in the antioxidant defense mechanism lead to the increase in oxidative stress in diabetes. Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) with ROS scavenging ability may have a potential effect on diabetic animals, a model for high oxidative stress. Therefore, the present study examined the possible anti-diabetic effect of ERW in two different diabetic animal models. The genetically diabetic mouse strain C57BL/6J-db/db (db/db) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse were used as insulin deficient type 1 and insulin resistant type 2 animal model, respectively. ERW, provided as a drinking water, significantly reduced the blood glucose concentration and improved glucose tolerance in both animal models. However, ERW fail to affect blood insulin levels in STZ-diabetic mice whereas blood insulin level was markedly increased in genetically diabetic db/db mice. This improved blood glucose control could result from enhanced insulin sensitivity, as well as increased insulin release. The present data suggest that ERW may function as an orally effective anti-diabetic agent and merit further studies on its precise mechanism.

Murine Balb/c 3T3 cells are widely used for transformation experiments because they lose contact inhibition ability when transformed. Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW), which is produced near a cathode during electrolysis of water, is an alkaline drinking water that is beneficial to health. ERW contains a high concentration of dissolved hydrogen and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with a small amount of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (Pt nps) derived from Pt-coated titanium electrodes. Pt nps stably disperse in aqueous solution for a long time, and convert hydrogen molecules to active hydrogen (atomic hydrogen) that can scavenge ROS. Therefore, ERW supplemented with synthesized Pt nps is a model strong reduced water. This is the first report that ERW supplemented with synthesized Pt nps strongly prevents transformation of Balb/c 3T3 cells. ERW was prepared by electrolysis of 0.002 M NaOH solution using a batch-type electrolysis device.

Statistical analysis of the results for treatment versus baseline scores was performed using a Hotelling T test and repeated - measures analysis of variance. Values of .04 or less were considered statistically significant. A total of 25 patients (mean age, 24.7 years, ranging from 15 to 47.years) completed the study. The mean reduction in total acne lesion counts from baseline to the end of treatment was 40.9 for the EOW - treated side (right side) and 18 for the untreated side (Heft side) (P=.04).

The ionic product of water (pKw) was estimated by measurements of pH and by a neutralization titration method. As an indicator of oxidative damage, Reactive Oxygen Species- (ROS) mediated DNA strand breaks were measured by the conversion of supercoiled phiX-174 RF I double-strand DNA to open and linear forms. Reduced water had a tendency to suppress single-strand breakage of DNA induced by reactive oxygen species produced by H2O2/Cu (II) and HQ/Cu (II) systems.

Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) with reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability may have a potential effect on reduction of hemodialysis-induced oxidative stress in ESRD patients. Methods: We developed a chemiluminescence emission spectrum and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis to assess the effect of ERW replacement on plasma ROS (H2O2 and HOCl) scavenging activity and oxidized lipid or protein production in ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis. Oxidized markers, dityrosine, methylguanidine, and phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide, and inflammatory markers, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined. Results: Although hemodialysis efficiently removes dityrosine and creatinine, hemodialysis increased oxidative stress, including phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide, and methylguanidine. Hemodialysis reduced the plasma ROS scavenging activity, as shown by the augmented reference H2O2 and HOCl counts (Rh2o2 and Rhocl, respectively) and decreased antioxidative activity (expressed as total antioxidant status in this study). ERW administration diminished hemodialysis-enhanced Rh2o2 and Rhocl, minimized oxidized and inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6), and partly restored total antioxidant status during 1-month treatment. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that hemodialysis with ERW administration may efficiently increase the H2O2- and HOCl-dependent antioxidant defense and reduce H2O2- and HOCl-induced oxidative stress.

The average age of the test persons was 67,9 years; the average duration of their stay in Nordenau was 3 days for group 1 (61 patients), respectively 10,7 days for group 2 (40 patients) taking two tunnel walks of 30 minutes each and consuming two litres of water daily. The spring water was considered to be a possible active substance, as it possesses the quality of ‘reduced water’. The diagnostic parameters of blood sugar, HbAlc, Chol., HDL, LDL and Trigl. were tested twice — at the beginning and at the end of the participants’ stay in Nordenau. The survey pointed to a significant improvement with regard to blood sugar and HbAlc in group 2. The counts of Chol., HDL, LDL and Trigl. showed only slight improvements below statistical significance. In view of the fact that the ‘reduced water’ shows “in vitro” an effect on the glucose absorption by muscle- and fat cells similar to that of insulin — an effect which can be reproduced in animal experiments from Shirahata — the results of this study seem to have sufficient correlation with those of basic research to be worthy of serious consideration.",Positive,Human,Whole Body,Diabetes (Type II),Oxidative Stress,"Water, Commercial (Nordenau)",Alkaline,Ingestion,,,Germany

Reduced water (RW) such as hydrogen-rich electrolyzed reduced water and natural reduced waters like Hita Tenryosui water in Japan and Nordenau water in Germany that are known to improve various diseases, could protect a hamster pancreatic beta cell line, HIT-T15 from alloxan-induced cell damage. Alloxan, a diabetogenic compound, is used to induce type 1 diabetes mellitus in animals. Its diabetogenic effect is exerted via the production of ROS. Alloxan-treated HIT-T15 cells exhibited lowered viability, increased intracellular ROS levels, elevated cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration, DNA fragmentation, decreased intracellular ATP levels and lowering of glucose-stimulated release of insulin. RW completely prevented the generation of alloxan-induced ROS, increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, decrease of intracellular ATP level, and lowering of glucose-stimulated insulin release, and strongly blocked DNA fragmentation, partially suppressing the lowering of viability of alloxan-treated cells. Intracellular ATP levels and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were increased by RW to 2-3.5 times and 2-4 times, respectively, suggesting that RW enhances the glucose-sensitivity and glucose response of beta-cells. The protective activity of RW was stable at 4 degrees C for over a month, but was lost by autoclaving. These results suggest that RW protects pancreatic beta-cells from alloxan-induced cell damage by preventing alloxan-derived ROS generation. RW may be useful in preventing alloxan-induced type 1-diabetes mellitus. ",Positive,Cell Culture,Pancreas,Diabetes (Type I),Oxidative Stress,Water (Electrolysis),Alkaline,Culture Media,,,Japan

The aim of the present study was to determine whether electrolyzed alkaline water (EAW) can ameliorate aspirin-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats, and whether EAW can inhibit the increased gastric TNF-α expression associated with neutrophil accumulation and gastric epithelial cell apoptosis. EAW (pH 10.5, oxidation-reduction potential -450mW) was produced by electricity resolution of tap water with a device that used a platinum electrode. EAW was administered to rats via free drinking for 14 days. Aspirin-induced injury was produced by the intragastric administration of aspirin (200mg/kg) and HCl (0.15N, 8.0ml/kg). After 3h the animals were killed, and the gastric mucosal tissue was used for the assessment of macroscopic damage and tissue-associated myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, the quantitation of TNF-α protein, and the assay of epithelial cell apoptosis. The expression of TNF-α mRNA was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 1h after aspirin administration. In the group drinking tap water, intragastric administration of acidified aspirin induced hyperemia and hemorrhagic erosions in rat stomachs. The increase in the total gastric erosive area after aspirin administration was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with EAW. The increases in MPO activity and epithelial cell apoptosis after aspirin administration were significantly inhibited by treatment with EAW. The gastric content of TNF-α increased and the expression of TNF-α mRNA was up-regulated after aspirin treatment. However, the peak TNF-α mRNA expression 1h after aspirin administration was inhibited by EAW. Based on these data, we conclude that the beneficial effects of EAW on aspirin-induced gastric mucosal injury may be attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of TNF-α expression.",Positive,Rat,Stomach,Gastric Mucosal Injury,Drug Toxicity (Aspirin),Water (Electrolysis),Alkaline,Ingestion,,,Japan

Moreover, neither the reduced water nor its electrolyte solution showed any superoxide dismutation activity by itself.

It has been found that the behaviour of H2 in reduced water, which was activated by a platinum electrode, differed from that of H2 introduced by bubbling of hydrogen gas. The former decreased H2O2, whereas the latter did not.

Since there is only limited physiological data on the use of H2 as a diving gas, direct calorimetry and respirometry were used to determine whether physiological responses to hyperbaric H2 and He are different in guinea pigs. The data suggested that responses in hyperbaric heliox and hydrox cannot be explained solely by the thermal properties of the two gas mixtures. To increase the washout rate of H2, a H2-metabolizing microbe (Methanobrevibacter smithii) was tested that converts H2 to H2O and CH4. Using pigs (Sus scrofa) comparisons were made between untreated controls, saline-injected controls, and animals injected with M. smithii into the large intestine. To simulate a H2 dive, pigs were placed in a dry hyperbaric chamber and compressed to different pressures (22.3-25.7 atm) for times of 30-1440 min. Subsequently, pigs were decompressed to 11 atm at varying rates (0.45-1.80 atm • min-1), and observed for severe symptoms of DCS for 1 h. Chamber gases (O2, N2, He, H2, CH4) were monitored using gas chromatography throughout the dive. Release of CH4 in untreated pigs indicated that H2 was being metabolized by native intestinal microbes and results indicated that native H2-metabolizing microbes may provide some protection against DCS following hyperbaric H2 exposure. M. smithii injection further enhanced CH4 output and lowered DCS incidence. A probabilistic model estimated the effect of H2-metabolism on the probability of DCS, P(DCS), after hyperbaric H2 exposure. The data set included varying compression and decompression sequences for controls and animals with intestinal injections of H2 metabolizing microbes. The model showed that increasing total activity of M. smithii injected into the animals reduced P(DCS). Reducing the tissue concentration of the inert gas significantly reduced the risk of DCS in pigs, further supporting the hypothesis that DCS is primarily caused by elevated tissue inert gas tension. The data provide promising evidence for the development of biochemical decompression as an aid to human diving.",Positive,Pig,Whole Body,Diving,Decompression Sickness,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,Helium; Oxygen,Canada

The present drinking water study was undertaken in two strains of autoimmune disease prone mice to establish the spontaneous disease process and longevity. Weanling MRL/lpr and NZBxNZW [B/W] F1 female mice were provided daily with (1) tap water [pH ∼7.5, oxygen reduction potential (ORP)-600+] (2) electrolyzed water with pH of ∼9.0 and ORP∼400- and (3) hyper-reduced water with pH∼10.0 and ORP∼600-. Mice were provided H2O and chow diet ad libitum and weekly body weights and spontaneous deaths were recorded. The mean survival data recorded as days for MRL/lpr mice [25 mice/group] is as follows: (1) tap water 235±25, (2) reduced water 287±40 and (3) hyper-reduced water 346±45 days [<0.05]. In the case of B/W mice [25 mice/group], (1) tap water 269±16, (2) reduced water 298±19 and (3) hyper-reduced 302±18 days. A significantly decreased (<0.05) serum lipid peroxides were observed in mice fed hyper-reduced H2O. Also, the source of water did not alter lymphocyte subsets or their response to mitogens. In summary, hyper-reduced water with pH∼10.0 appears to inhibit autoimmune disease of MRL/lpr mice whereas only a modest increased lifespan was noted for B/W mice. The increased lifespan by electrolyzed H2O appears to be related to the changes in free radicals and antioxidant enzyme levels.",Positive,Mouse,Whole Body,Aging,Oxidative Stress,Water (Electrolysis),Alkaline,Ingestion,,,United States

To clarify the cause of myocardial lesions, the activities of myosin ATPase, actomyosin ATPase and creatine kinase (CK) in myocardium of rats given AKW at 15 weeks-old were compared with those in myocardium of rats given tap water (TPW). Furthermore, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of myocardiac myosin and isoelectric focusing (IEF) of myocardiac CK were performed which revealed a distinct difference between AKW and TPW groups. The activities of myosin ATPase and actomyosin ATPase in the AKW group were higher than those in the TPW group, and these elevated activities were caused by the degradation of myosin in the AKW group judging from the SDS-PAGE pattern of myosin. On the other hand, the activity of CK in the AKW group was lower than that in the TPW group, and the IEF pattern of CK showed leakage of myocardiac CK. These results indicate that increases in actomyosin ATPase activity and myosin ATPase activity, plus the decrease in CK activity caused the disorder of coupled reaction in male rats given AKW at 15 weeks-old.

ECG changes were the same in the three divers. Marked bradycardia rapidly appeared at the beginning of compression, then this response adapted throughout the dive. P-R, QRS, and Q-T intervals and the S-T segment did not change significantly. The QRS axis remained stable. However, a rightward shift occurred in P and T vector angles. These changes were correlated with time and gas density, respectively. The modifications of ventricular repolarization during compression are similar to those we observed during the HYDRA 9 COMEX dive. They may correspond to changes in duration of myocardial cell repolarization due to increased intrathoracic pressure changes with dense-gas breathing.

Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the following 6 groups: sham, only spinal ischemia, 3% hydrogen gas (spinal ischemia + 3% hydrogen gas), 2% hydrogen gas (spinal ischemia + 2% hydrogen gas), 1% hydrogen gas (spinal ischemia + 1% hydrogen gas), and hydrogen gas dihydrokainate (spinal ischemia + dihydrokainate [selective inhibitor of glutamate transporter-1] + 3% hydrogen gas). Hydrogen gas inhalation was initiated 10 minutes before the ischemia. For the hydrogen gas dihydrokainate group, glutamate transporter-1 inhibitor was administered 20 minutes before the ischemia. Immunofluorescence was performed to assess the expression of glutamate transporter-1 in the ventral horn. Results: The increase in extracellular glutamate induced by spinal ischemia was significantly suppressed by 3% hydrogen gas inhalation (P < .05). This effect was produced in increasing order: 1%, 2%, and 3%. Conversely, the preadministration of glutamate transporter-1 inhibitor diminished the suppression of spinal ischemia-induced glutamate increase observed during the inhalation of 3% hydrogen gas. Immunofluorescence indicated the expression of glutamate transporter-1 in the spinal ischemia group was significantly decreased compared with the sham group, which was attenuated by 3% hydrogen gas inhalation (P < .05). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated hydrogen gas inhalation exhibits a protective and concentration-dependent effect against spinal ischemic injury, and glutamate transporter-1 has an important role in the protective effects against spinal cord injury.

Hydrogen (H2) inhalation has been reported to have a variety of tumor‑suppressive effects, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, HeLa cervical cancer cells and HaCaT keratinocytes treated with H2, and a HeLa xenograft mouse model subjected to H2 inhalation were established. TUNEL, Cell Counting Kit‑8 and Ki67 staining assays were used to detect cell apoptosis and proliferation. Oxidative stress was determined according to the levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase. Tumor growth was recorded every 3 days, and the excised tumors were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. High‑throughput RNA sequencing and subsequent Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed in HeLa‑treated and un‑treated HeLa cells. The expression of hypoxia‑inducible factor (HIF)‑1α and NF‑κB p65 was verified by western blotting, immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The results revealed an increased apoptosis rate, and reduced cell proliferation and oxidative stress in H2‑treated HeLa cells but not in HaCaT cells. Similarly, decreased tumor growth and cell proliferation, and enhanced cell apoptosis were observed in H2‑treated HeLa tumors. RNA sequencing and GO analysis suggest that downregulated HIF1A (HIF‑1α mRNA) and RelA (NF‑κB p65) levels, and reduced NF‑κB signaling were associated with the antitumor effect of H2. Finally, decreased HIF‑1α and NF‑κB p65 expression both at the transcriptional and translational levels were observed in H2‑treated HeLa cells and in HeLa‑derived tumors.

Among them, alcoholic liver disease is the most frequent and serious disease. Electrolytic hydrogen water (EHW) is produced at the cathode during electrolysis of water and contains a large amount of molecular hydrogen and a low content of platinum nanoparticles with alkaline properties. In this study, we found that EHW inhibits ethanol-induced cytotoxicity by decreasing the intracellular acetaldehyde, a toxic substance produced by ethanol degradation, in hepatocyte cell lines HepG2. Analysis of the mechanism of action revealed that EHW inhibits the metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde by suppressing alcohol dehydrogenase. EHW also promotes the metabolism of acetaldehyde to acetic acid by activating aldehyde dehydrogenase, which plays to reduce aldehyde toxicity and intracellular reactive oxygen species in HepG2 cells. These functions were correlated with the concentration of molecular hydrogen in EHW, and were abolished by degassing treatment, suggesting that molecular hydrogen may contribute as a functional factor in the suppression of ethanol-induced hepatocellular damage. Furthermore, hydrogen water with high dissolved hydrogen molecule showed the same hepatocellular protective effect against ethanol as the EHW.

Molecular hydrogen exhibits therapeutic activity for the treatment and prevention of many diseases. Our study investigated the possible therapeutic effects of hydrogen and its mechanism of action in a LIR-induced acute lung injury (ALI) model. Materials and methods: Limb ischaemia/-reperfusion model was established in mice. The hydrogen-saturated saline was administered by intraperitoneal injection. Protein level of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), haem oxygenase-1 (HO1) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining and western blotting.

Quantification of ceramides in lung was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Key findings: Molecular hydrogen exhibited a protective effect on the LIR-induced ALI model. Hydrogen decreased malondialdehyde and increased superoxide dismutase activity in lung tissues. Additionally, hydrogen activated Nrf2 signalling in lung tissues. Hydrogen could inhibit the upregulation of autophagy in the present rodent model. Furthermore, ceramide was accumulated in lung tissues because of LIR; however, hydrogen altered the accumulation status. Significance: Molecular hydrogen was found to be therapeutically effective in the LIR-induced ALI model; the mechanisms of action included modulation of antioxidation and autophagy.

However, there are still many unclear points regarding its effectiveness in the skin. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the protective effect of H2 against ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-related stress injury in human epidermal HaCaT cells. We investigated the effects of H2 against three types of UV-derived oxidative stress using human skin keratinocytes: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH)-induced lipid peroxidation stress, and glyoxal-induced carbonyl stress. Our results showed that H2 exerted cytoprotective effects against stress induced by H2O2, t-BuOOH, and glyoxal. Furthermore, our results also revealed that H2 suppressed H2O2-induced increases in intracellular peroxide and H2O2 levels, and suppressed the progression of lipid peroxidation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that H2 can exert protective effects against oxidative stress-, lipid peroxidation-, and carbonyl stress-induced cellular injuries in human keratinocytes, partly mediated via suppression of intracellular oxidative stress and peroxide generation.

However, both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation improve exercise performance including mitochondrial ATP production and force of muscle contraction. They also are essential mediators in providing the benefits and training adaptations that occur from exercise. Nitric oxide (NO•) is a gaseous radical that increases blood flow via dilation of the blood vessels and also improves mitochondrial function. Therefore, NO• improves exercise performance and capacity, but only when produced at the right times and in the right locations. Excessive levels of NO• contribute to nitrosative stress due to the spontaneous reaction with superoxide to form toxic peroxynitrite. This decreases the ½ life of nitric oxide resulting in less NO• benefits and in cellular damage leading to impaired exercise performance. In contrast to conventional antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, molecular hydrogen (H2) has been demonstrated to exert selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing only excessive inflammation and reducing toxic oxidants without disturbing important signaling ROS, like NO•. Moreover, H2 can regulate NO• production, increase its circulating ½ life and beneficial NO• cycling, potentiate the bioactivity of NO•, and act as a NO• mimetic by increasing cGMP levels. At the same time H2 can prevent peroxynitrite formation and reduce the harm from NO• metabolism, such as lower nitrotyrosine levels. Methods. The effects of an H2-infused, nitric oxide-producing beverage (Hydro Shot) on nitric oxide production, blood flow, aerobic and anaerobic exercise, and cognitive function were assessed. Results. Ingestion of the functional beverage significantly increased production of NO• and a concomitant increase in blood flow. It also improved aerobic performance as measured by VO2, and anaerobic performance as indicated by delayed muscle fatigue, and increased peak torque during maximal isokinetic leg extensions. Additionally, the H2/NO• combination significantly improved indices of cognitive function including, focus, speed, plasticity, etc. Conclusion. The molecular crosstalk between H2 and NO•coupled with these preliminary results indicate that Hydro Shot is uniquely qualified for sports performance and exercise medicine and warrants additional clinical and mechanistic research.",Positive,Human,Whole Body,Excercise,Performance Enhancement,"Water, Commercial (Hydro Shot)",Neutral,Ingestion,,Nitric Oxide (NO),United States

Lungs are among the organs that are affected in MOF, resulting in acute lung injury. Inflammation is an important factor that causes immune cell dysfunction in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Autophagy is involved in the process of inflammation and also occurs in response to cell and tissue injury in several diseases. We previously demonstrated that hydrogen alleviated the inflammation-induced cell injury and organ damage in septic mice. Aim: The focus of the present study was to elucidate whether mitophagy mediates the inflammatory response or oxidative injury in sepsis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we evaluated the role of mitophagy in the protective effects of hydrogen against cell injury or organ dysfunction in sepsis. Method: RAW 264.7 macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used as an in vitro model for inflammation, and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced acute lung injury mice were used as an in vivo model for sepsis. The key protein associated with mitophagy, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), was knocked down by PINK1 shRNA transfection in RAW 264.7 macrophages or mice. Results: Hydrogen ameliorated cell injury and enhanced mitophagy in macrophages stimulated by LPS. PINK1 was required for the mitigation of the cell impairment in LPS-stimulated macrophages by hydrogen treatment. PINK1 knockdown abrogated the beneficial effects of hydrogen on mitophagy in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Hydrogen inhibited acute lung injury in CLP mice via activation of PINK1-mediated mitophagy. Conclusion: These results suggest that PINK1-mediated mitophagy plays a key role in the protective effects of hydrogen against cell injury in LPS-induced inflammation and CLP-induced acute lung injury.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of molecular hydrogen (H2) on MNU-induced corneal endothelial cell (CEC) injury and the underlying mechanism. Methods: MNU-induced animal models of CEC injury were washed with hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) for 14 days. Immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemical staining, and corneal endothelial assessment were applied to determine architectural and cellular changes on the corneal endothelium following HRS treatment. MNU-induced cell models of CEC injury were co-cultured with H2. The effect of H2 was examined using morphological and functional assays. Results: It was shown that MNU could inhibit the proliferation and specific physiological functions of CECs by increasing apoptosis and decreasing the expression of ZO-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase, whereas H2 improved the proliferation and physiological function of CECs by anti-apoptosis. Cell experiments further confirmed that H2 could reverse MNU damage to CECs by decreasing oxidative stress injury, interfering with the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway and the FOXO3a/p53/p21 pathway. Conclusions: This study suggests that topical application of H2 could protect CECs against corneal damage factors through anti-apoptotic effect, reduce the incidence and severity of corneal endothelial decompensation, and maintain corneal transparency.

Our hypothesis on the effectiveness of alkaline electrolyzed water (AEW) proposes that ingestion of AEW, considered possessing antioxidative properties, increases the number of Bifidobacteria and improves stool hardness and gastrointestinal symptoms. A double-blind, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the connection between stool consistency and change in gut microbiota composition induced by drinking hydrogen-dissolved AEW. The participants drank 500 mL of purified tap water or AEW every day for 2 weeks. In this study, drinking AEW did not drastically change gut microbiota, but it appeared to act on a specific bacterial species. Drinking AEW was confirmed to cause an increase in Bifidobacterium. The AEW group also saw stool consistency significantly converge to Bristol stool scale Type 4 ('normal'). Therefore, it is highly likely that the gut microbiota will be changed by drinking AEW.

Hydrogen gas has been previously reported to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent against ischemia-associated diseases by regulating mitochondrial function. The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of hydrogen gas post-conditioning against neuronal pyroptosis after SAH, with specific focus on the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ (mitoKATP) channels. Following SAH induction by endovascular perforation, rats were treated with inhalation of 2.9% hydrogen gas for 2 h post-perforation. Neurologic deficits, brain water content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, neuronal pyroptosis, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and pyroptosis-associated proteins IL-1β and IL-18 were evaluated 24 h after perforation by a modified Garcia method, ratio of wet/dry weight, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, immunofluorescence and western blot assays, respectively. An inhibitor of the mitoKATP channel, 5-hydroxydecanoate sodium (5-HD), was used to assess the potential role of the mitoKATP-ERK1/2-p38 MAPK signal pathway. Hydrogen gas post-conditioning significantly alleviated brain edema and improved neurologic function, reduced ROS production and neuronal pyroptosis, suppressed the expression of IL-1β and IL-18 whilst upregulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but downregulated p38 MAPK activation 24 h post-SAH. These aforementioned effects neuroprotective were partially reversed by 5-HD treatment. Therefore, these observations suggest that post-conditioning with hydrogen gas ameliorated SAH-induced neuronal pyroptosis at least in part through the mitoKATP/ERK1/2/p38 MAPK signaling pathway.",Positive,Rat,Brain,Brain Injury,Intracranial Hemorrhage,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,China

Several studies reported that the administration of various compounds with antioxidant effects can treat oxidative stress-induced hearing loss. However, traditional systemic drug administration to the human inner ear is problematic and has not been successful in a clinical setting. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop rescue treatment for patients with acute acoustic injuries. Hydrogen gas has antioxidant effects, rapid distribution, and distributes systemically after inhalation.The purpose of this study was to determine the protective efficacy of a single dose of molecular hydrogen (H2) on cochlear structures. Guinea pigs were divided into six groups and sacrificed immediately after or at 1 or 2 weeks. The animals were exposed to broadband noise for 2 h directly followed by 1-h inhalation of 2% H2 or room air. Electrophysiological hearing thresholds using frequency-specific auditory brainstem response (ABR) were measured prior to noise exposure and before sacrifice. ABR thresholds were significantly lower in H2-treated animals at 2 weeks after exposure, with significant preservation of outer hair cells in the entire cochlea. Quantification of synaptophysin immunoreactivity revealed that H2 inhalation protected the cochlear inner hair cell synaptic structures containing synaptophysin. The inflammatory response was greater in the stria vascularis, showing increased Iba1 due to H2 inhalation.Repeated administration of H2 inhalation may further improve the therapeutic effect. This animal model does not reproduce conditions in humans, highlighting the need for additional real-life studies in humans.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) protects against tissue injury by reducing oxidative stress. We evaluated the efficacy of oral H2-rich water (HW) intake in preventing unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal injury in rats. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley UUO or control rats were administered with distilled water (DW) or HW for 2 weeks post-surgery. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of kidney samples were performed. Results: Histological changes were not apparent in the sham-operated kidneys. However, UUO kidneys were found to have widened interstitial spaces and tubular dilatation. Compared with the UUO + DW group, HW administration attenuated tubulointerstitial injury and reduced interstitial fibrotic area, causing a substantial decline in the frequency of α-SMA-, ED-1-, and TGF-β1-positive cells in the UUO + HW group. The decrease in the klotho mRNA expression in the UUO + HW group was less pronounced than that in the UUO + DW group. Conclusion: Oral HW intake reduced oxidative stress and prevented interstitial fibrosis in UUO kidneys, potentially involving klotho in the underlying mechanism. Impact: Oral intake of hydrogen-rich water (HW) can reduce oxidative stress and suppress interstitial fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced renal injury in rats. This mechanism possibly involves klotho, which is known for its antiaging roles. The association between molecular hydrogen and klotho in renal fibrosis is well known; this is the first report on the association in a unilateral ureteral obstruction model. Drinking HW is a safe and convenient treatment for oxidative stress-induced pathologies, without side effects. As a prospect for future research, oral HW intake to treat oxidative stress may improve renal fibrosis in congenital obstructive nephropathy.

In this work, a novel PdMo bimetallene was synthesized by a solvothermal reduction method, and it was explored and applied in the field of anti-tumor therapy for the first time. The absorption peak of the PdMo bimetallene can be precisely adjusted in the NIR biological window (700-1350 nm) only by changing the synthesis time. At the same time, it also shows strong light absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency. Specifically, the photothermal conversion efficiencies at 808 nm, 980 nm and 1064 nm are 43.1%, 51.7% and 69.15%, respectively. Surprisingly, a PdMo bimetallene is an efficient catalyst, which can effectively promote hydrogen production from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) under acidic and photothermal conditions. Benefitting from these excellent properties, a multifunctional composite nano therapeutic agent (PdMo@AB@HA) was developed via layer-by-layer surface modification with AB and hyaluronic acid (HA). In this way, the synergistic PTT/hydrogen therapy of PdMo@AB@HA composite nanosheets in the NIR-I and NIR-II windows (808 nm, 980 nm, and 1064 nm) on mouse tumor xenografts of different depths was realized. Furthermore, the controlled release of hydrogen, targeted endocytosis, efficient eradication of tumors of different depths and high biosafety were systematically proved in vitro and in vivo.

Its etiology is multifactorial but related to the overproduction of inflammatory and oxidative mediators.

H2 is recognized as having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may qualify it as a novel therapeutic for colitis. We induced an acute model of colitis in mice by administering dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days. Mice were divided into five groups (n=6); normal, colitis, H2-treated colitis, sulfasalazine-treated colitis, and H2 plus sulfasalazine-treated colitis. From days three to ten, mice were given H2, sulfasalazine, or both.

There was a trend for the combination treatment to be more effective than either HRW or sulfasalazine alone. Furthermore, HRW tended to be as effective as, and often more effective than, sulfasalazine. HRW may serve as a therapeutic for ameliorating DSS-induced colitis in mice.

Results: During chicken egg storage, H2 MAP not only slowed down or delayed the reduction in antioxidant capacities, but also alleviated the deterioration of egg quality. The extent of micro-cracks in the eggshell was also negatively influenced by H2 , which might result in eggs being less vulnerable to microbes. The earlier results demonstrated that the H2 MAP-extended shelf life of chicken eggs might be caused by the responses of eggshell and re-establishment of redox homeostasis. According to the data collected from different provinces of China, cost-economics analysis further suggested that the increase in the extra cost caused by H2 was trivial compared with the original price of eggs.

However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Polarization and apoptosis of macrophages are essential factors in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Moreover, autophagy is involved in the regulation of both macrophage polarization and apoptosis. Therefore, this study investigated the ability of HRS to attenuate ALI through regulation of the polarization and apoptosis of alveolar macrophages (AMs) during sepsis by modulating autophagy. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used to prepare the sepsis-induced lung injury animal model. Rat lung tissue was harvested after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, in the presence or absence of HRS, and the AMs were analyzed for changes in polarization, apoptosis, and autophagy. The rat AM cell line NR8383 was used to examine these processes in vitro using Western blot analysis, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Results: LPS-induced ALI in rats was associated with an increase in autophagy, apoptosis, and M1 polarization but a decrease in M2 polarization in AMs. These effects were reversed by administration of HRS. Inhibition of AM autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) decreased apoptosis and M1 polarization and increased M2 polarization, paralleling the effects of HRS. Conclusions: HRS could attenuate ALI in septic rats through regulation of AM polarization and a reduction in apoptosis by suppressing autophagy. This may represent a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of ALI caused by sepsis.

In this study, the effect of H2 on M1/M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages in COPD rats was observed, and its anti-inflammatory mechanism was further elucidated. Methods: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups including the control, COPD and H2 group. A rat model of COPD was established by cigarette exposure combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction. H2 therapy was administered 2 hours per day for 14 days. Lung function and pathology were assessed. The levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA, protein expression and immunoreactivity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase (Arg)-1 in lung were observed by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: Compared with the control rats, there were a significant decline in lung function, a marked inflammatory infiltration and pulmonary parenchymal remodeling and the increases of IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels in BALF and lung tissue, but a lower expression of IL-10 in COPD rats. The iNOS mRNA and protein expression, as well as its optical density (OD), were increased significantly in lung tissue, while those of Arg-1 decreased significantly. H2 treatment improved the lung function and the parenchymal inflammation, reversed the increased levels of IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β1, and the lower IL-10. Meanwhile, H2 also down-regulated the expression of iNOS, but up-regulated expression of Arg-1 in lung tissue. Conclusion: H2 reduces inflammation in the lung of COPD, which may be related to its inhibition of M1 type polarization and activation of M2 type polarization of alveolar macrophage.

The UCNP functions as a transducer, converting NIR light into upconversion luminescence for simultaneous imaging and therapy in situ. Functioning as light-harvesting antennas, AuNPs are used to detect the local concentration of ROS for FRET biosensing, while the Chla activates the photosynthesis of H2 gas to scavenge local excess ROS.

However, high diffusivity and low solubility make it difficult to accumulate in the local lesions. Herein, we develop H2 self-generation nano-platform by in situ water splitting driven by near infrared (NIR) laser. In this work, core-shell nanoparticles (CSNPs) of NaGdF4:Yb, Tm/g-C3N4/Cu3P (UCC) nanocomposites as core encapsulated with zeolitic-imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) modified with folic acid as shell are designed and synthesized. Due to the acid responsive ZIF-8 shell, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and folate receptor mediated endocytosis, CSNPs are selectively captured by tumor cells. Upon 980 nm laser irradiation, CSNPs exhibits high production capacity of H2 and active oxygen species (ROS), as well as appropriate photothermal conversion temperature. Furthermore, the rising temperature increases the Fenton reaction rate of Cu(I) with H2O2 and strengthens curative effect of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). The excess glutathione (GSH) in tumor microenvironment (TME) can deplete positive hole produced in valence band of g-C3N4 in g-C3N4/Cu3P Z-scheme heterojunction. GSH also can reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), ensuring continuous Fenton reaction.

The reaction of H2 with HO⋅ has been studied by pulse radiolysis in the past and is too slow to be physiologically relevant, not to mention that the reaction yields the reactive H⋅ radical. We therefore investigated whether H2 reacts with ONOOH and whether the presence of H2 influences the yield of nitration of tyrosine by ONOOH. With only negative results, we entertained the notion that H2 may possibly exert its beneficial effects by reducing Fe(III) centers, oxidized during oxidative stress.

The ideal scavenger for active oxygen should be 'active hydrogen'. 'Active hydrogen' can be produced in reduced water near the cathode during electrolysis of water. Reduced water exhibits high pH, low dissolved oxygen (DO), extremely high dissolved molecular hydrogen (DH), and extremely negative redox potential (RP) values. Strongly electrolyzed-reduced water, as well as ascorbic acid, (+)-catechin and tannic acid, completely scavenged O.-2 produced by the hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase (HX-XOD) system in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of reduced water is stable at 4 degrees C for over a month and was not lost even after neutralization, repeated freezing and melting, deflation with sonication, vigorous mixing, boiling, repeated filtration, or closed autoclaving, but was lost by opened autoclaving or by closed autoclaving in the presence of tungsten trioxide which efficiently adsorbs active atomic hydrogen. Water bubbled with hydrogen gas exhibited low DO, extremely high DH and extremely low RP values, as does reduced water, but it has no SOD-like activity. These results suggest that the SOD-like activity of reduced water is not due to the dissolved molecular hydrogen but due to the dissolved atomic hydrogen (active hydrogen). Although SOD accumulated H2O2 when added to the HX-XOD system, reduced water decreased the amount of H2O2 produced by XOD. Reduced water, as well as catalase and ascorbic acid, could directly scavenge H2O2. Reduce water suppresses single-strand breakage of DNA b active oxygen species produced by the Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that reduced water can scavenge not only O2.- and H2O2, but also 1O2 and .OH.",Positive,Molecular Assay,Whole Body,ROS-Scavenging,Hydrogen Biology,Water (Electrolysis),Neutral,Assay Media,,,Japan

At the beginning of the study, the antimicrobial activity of the EW types with respect to bacteria and fungus was investigated. EWs below pH 7 were all effective in inactivating Enterococcus hirae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans completely. In vitro studies of cell cultures revealed that different concentrations of EWs were not cytotoxic for the L929 cells under 10- to 80-fold dilutions. In addition, it has been determined that produced EWs did not have irritation potential, according to the in vitro EpiDerm ™ , reconstituted skin irritation test in the frames of biocompatibility tests.

However, there is little information about total H2 excretion from different substrates or the extent to which it is metabolized in the colon. We have therefore measured total H2 and methane excretion in 10 healthy subjects using a whole body calorimeter. Breath gases were measured simultaneously with total excretion in response to lactulose, pectin, and banana starch. Metabolic activities of the predominant H2 consuming anaerobes (methanogenic, sulfate reducing, and acetogenic bacteria) were measured in fecal samples. Total H2 excretion on a starch and fiber-free diet was 35 +/- 6.1 mL/24 h +/- SEM. H2 from 7.5 g, 15 g, and 22.5 g lactulose was 88.1 +/- 22.4 mL, 227.0 +/- 60.7 mL, and 321.8 +/- 79.2 mL. Four of the subjects also excreted CH4, which was 51.3 +/- 5.5 mL, 97.3 +/- 18.4 mL, and 157.5 +/- 36.3 mL for the respective lactulose doses. H2 excretion was less in methanogenic subjects (7.9 mL/g lactulose) than in nonmethanogenic (17.3 mL/g), but total H2 excreted as, hydrogen + methane, was 34.9 mL/g. H2 from pectin (20 g) was 14.1% +/- 3.2% and from starch (22.2 g) 38.6% +/- 9.2% of an equivalent lactulose dose. Sixty-five percent of total H2 and CH4 was expired in breath at total excretion rates up to 200 mL/24 h. Over this the proportion decreased to 25% with an overall average of 58%. Only subjects with CH4 excretion in vivo showed methanogenesis in feces, whereas nonmethanogenic subjects showed high sulfate-reducing activity in feces (58.7 +/- 5.6 nmol 35SO4 reduced.h-1.g-1 wet wt vs. 7.9 +/- 2.0 nmol.h-1.g-1 in methanogens). Acetogenesis rates were very low in both groups. It was concluded that H2 excretion varies with different substrates. The proportion of H2 that is exhaled in breath is higher than currently accepted and varies with total excretion rate.

In recent years, on-site H2 gas generators, which produce high-purity H2 by water electrolysis, have begun to be introduced in hospitals, clinics, beauty salons, and fitness clubs because of their ease of use. In general, these generators produce H2 at a low-flow rate, so physicians are concerned that an effective blood concentration of H2 may not be ensured when the gas is delivered through a nasal cannula. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate blood concentrations of H2 delivered from an H2 gas generator via a nasal cannula. Methods: We administered 100% H2, produced by an H2 gas generator, at a low-flow rate of 250 mL/min via a nasal cannula to three spontaneously breathing micro miniature pigs. An oxygen mask was placed over the nasal cannula to administer oxygen while minimizing H2 leakage, and a catheter was inserted into the carotid artery to monitor the arterial blood H2 concentration. Results: During the first hour of H2 inhalation, the mean (standard error (SE)) H2 concentrations and saturations in the arterial blood of the three pigs were 1,560 (413) nL/mL and 8.85% (2.34%); 1,190 (102) nL/mL and 6.74% (0.58%); and 1,740 (181) nL/mL and 9.88% (1.03%), respectively. These values are comparable to the concentration one would expect if 100% of the H2 released from the H2 gas generator is taken up by the body. Conclusions: Inhalation of 100% H2 produced by an H2 gas generator, even at low-flow rates, can increase blood H2 concentrations to levels that previous non-clinical and clinical studies demonstrated to be therapeutically effective. The combination of a nasal cannula and an oxygen mask is a convenient way to reduce H2 leakage while maintaining oxygenation.

We inserted and secured catheters into the carotid artery (CA), portal vein (PV), and supra-hepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) to allow repeated blood sampling and performed bilateral thoracotomy to collapse the lungs. Then, using a hydrogen-absorbing alloy canister, we filled the lungs to the maximum inspiratory level with 100% H2. The pig was maintained for 30 seconds without resuming breathing, as if they were holding their breath. We collected blood from the three intravascular catheters after 0, 3, 10, 30, and 60 minutes and measured H2 concentration by gas chromatography. H2 concentration in the CA peaked immediately after breath holding; 3 min later, it dropped to 1/40 of the peak value. Peak H2 concentrations in the PV and IVC were 40% and 14% of that in the CA, respectively. However, H2 concentration decay in the PV and IVC (half-life: 310 s and 350 s, respectively) was slower than in the CA (half-life: 92 s). At 10 min, H2 concentration was significantly higher in venous blood than in arterial blood. At 60 min, H2 was detected in the portal blood at a concentration of 6.9-53 nL/mL higher than at steady state, and in the SVC 14-29 nL/mL higher than at steady state. In contrast, H2 concentration in the CA decreased to steady state levels.

These results indicate that the Mg-based micromotors can act as self-propelled carriers for enhanced intracellular hydrogen and cancer chemotherapy.

Inspired by a metalloenzyme in a variety of microorganisms, here we propose a photo-activated H2 nanogenerator that comprises a fluorinated chitosan (FCS), a chemotherapeutic drug (Gemcitabine, GEM), and a catalyst of H2 production ([FeFe]TPP) that can form self-assembled [FeFe]TPP/GEM/FCS nanoparticles (NPs).

Moreover, we discover that H2 gas in hydrogen-chemotherapy can inhibit mitochondrial function, hinder ATP synthesis, and cause the reduction of P-gp efflux pump function, which finally attenuate P-gp protein drug transport capacity in cancer cells.

However, most of the reported systems focused on the proof‐of‐concept on the in vitro level. Here, the successful fabrication of facile hydrogen‐powered microswimmers (HPMs) for precise and active therapy of acute ischemic stroke is demonstrated. The hydrogen (H2) generated locally from the designed magnesium (Mg) microswimmer functions not only as a propellant for motion, but also as an active ingredient for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation scavenging. Due to the continuous detachment of the produced H2, the motion of the microswimmers results in active H2 delivery that allows for enhanced extracellular and intracellular reducibility. With the help of a stereotaxic apparatus device, HPMs were injected precisely into the lateral ventricle of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. By scavenging ROS and inflammation via active H2, MCAO rats exhibit significant decrease in infarct volume, improved spatial learning and memory capability with minimal adverse effects, demonstrating efficient efficacy on anti‐ischemic stroke.

Several diseases and symptoms are related to active oxygen, and fatigue is also induced by increases in oxidative stress. The current randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted to investigate the effects of hydrogen-rich water（HRW）on attenuating fatigue induced by daily activities or mental tasks. Methods Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized to either oral administration of hydrogen-rich water containing 0.36 mg of hydrogen or placebo for 4 weeks. Subjective sensation and work efficacy were examined using the visual analogue scale（VAS）and the advanced trail making test（ATMT）, respectively, to evaluate the anti-fatigue effects of hydrogen-rich water. In addition, we measured serum malondialdehyde-modified low density lipoprotein （MDA-LDL）and derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites（d-ROMs）as possible mechanisms of action. Results On the VAS, the hydrogen-rich water group had a significantly lower sleepiness and tension score after 4-week administration, and a significantly higher motivation and relaxation score after mental tasks compared with the placebo group. On the ATMT, hydrogen-rich water significantly reduced the mean reaction time during mental tasks. The serum MDA-LDL level after 4-week administration was significantly lower compared with before administration in the hydrogen-rich water group. The serum d-ROM level was significantly correlated with the VAS fatigue sensation score in the hydrogen-rich water group. Conclusions These results suggest that hydrogen-rich water improves several subjective sensations accompanying fatigue induced by daily activities and mental tasks by enhancing work efficacy and attenuating fatigue during mental tasks.

Materials and methods: The study involved 20 patients (16 men and 4 women) with acquired heart valve disease who were operated on under CPB. Two groups of patients were formed. In group 1 (n=11), anesthesia included inhalations of molecular hydrogen, which was supplied to the breathing circuit of the ventilator at a concentration of 1.5-2.0% immediately after tracheal intubation and throughout the operation. In group 2 (n=9), inhalation of molecular hydrogen was not performed. Blood sampling was taken at 4 stages: immediately after anesthesia induction, before CPB and after its termination, and also one day after the operation. The intensity of the processes of lipid peroxidation was evaluated by the level of diene (DC) and triene (TC) conjugates, Schiff bases (SB). Results: In the patients of group 1, the arterial blood samples showed a decrease in the level of TC and SB, as compared to the first stage of the study, before the initiation of CPB and one day after the operation. An increase in the level of DC and TC was detected after the termination of CPB (p<0.05). In the venous blood samples, an increase in the level of DC was noted before the initiation of CPB, which was restored by the third stage of the study (p<0.05). At the same time, after the termination of CPB, a tendency towards a decrease in TC and SB was observed, which persisted one day after the operation.In the patients of group 2, an increase in the concentration of SB in the arterial blood samples was recorded during the study as compared to the first stage. The level of TC and SB in the venous blood samples increased one day after the operation. Conclusion: Intraoperative inhalation of molecular hydrogen leads to a decrease in the oxidative stress manifestation, it being most pronounced one day after the operation. This suggests that molecular hydrogen can be used in cardiac surgery as an effective and safe antioxidant.

The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) of rats in the AMI and H2 groups was ligated, while rats in the Sham group were threaded without ligation. In addition, 2% H2 was administered by inhalation for 24 h after ligation in the H2 group. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed after H2 inhalation, followed by collection of the serum and cardiac tissue of all rats. Results: H2 inhalation ameliorated the cardiac dysfunction, infarct size and inflammatory cell infiltration caused by AMI. Meanwhile, H2 inhalation reduced the concentration of serum Troponin I (TnI), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), cardiac malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-OHdG. In addition, H2 inhalation inhibited cardiac inflammation and pyroptosis relative proteins expression.

Inhaled hydrogen gas diminishes ischemia-reperfusion injury in models of shock, stroke, and cardiac arrest. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety of inhaled hydrogen gas at doses required for a clinical efficacy study. Design: Prospective, single-arm study. Setting: Tertiary care hospital. Patients/subjects: Eight healthy adult participants. Interventions: Subjects underwent hospitalized exposure to 2.4% hydrogen gas in medical air via high-flow nasal cannula (15 L/min) for 24 (n = 2), 48 (n = 2), or 72 (n = 4) hours. Measurements and main results: Endpoints included vital signs, patient- and nurse-reported signs and symptoms (stratified according to clinical significance), pulmonary function testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram, mini-mental state examinations, neurologic examination, and serologic testing prior to and following exposure. All adverse events were verified by two clinicians external to the study team and an external Data and Safety Monitoring Board. All eight participants (18-30 yr; 50% female; 62% non-Caucasian) completed the study without early termination. No clinically significant adverse events occurred in any patient. Compared with baseline measures, there were no clinically significant changes over time in vital signs, pulmonary function testing results, Mini-Mental State Examination scores, neurologic examination findings, electrocardiogram measurements, or serologic tests for hematologic (except for clinically insignificant increases in hematocrit and platelet counts), renal, hepatic, pancreatic, or cardiac injury associated with hydrogen gas inhalation. Conclusions: Inhalation of 2.4% hydrogen gas does not appear to cause clinically significant adverse effects in healthy adults. Although these data suggest that inhaled hydrogen gas may be well tolerated, future studies need to be powered to further evaluate safety. These data will be foundational to future interventional studies of inhaled hydrogen gas in injury states, including following cardiac arrest.

Sports-related TBIs are estimated to be more than several million per year. The pathophysiology of TBIs involves high levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, dysregulation of ion homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. There is also a reduction in cerebral blood flow, leading to hypoxia and reduced removal of metabolic waste, which further exacerbates the injury. There is currently no recognized effective medical treatment or intervention for TBIs, which may in part be due to the difficulty of drug delivery through the blood-brain barrier. Molecular hydrogen has recently emerged as a neuroprotective medical gas against cerebral infarction and neurodegenerative diseases including TBIs. Its small molecular size and nonpolar nature allow it to easily diffuse through the blood-brain barrier, cell membranes and subcellular compartments. Hydrogen has been shown to exert selective anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects by regulating various transcription factors and protein phosphorylation cascades. Nitric oxide is another well-recognized medical gas that plays divergent roles in protecting from and in the recovery of TBIs, as well as in contributing to their pathophysiology and injury. Excessive activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase leads to excess inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative damage as well as a paradoxical nitric oxide depletion in the locations it is needed. Hydrogen regulates nitric oxide production and metabolism, which enhances its benefits while reducing its harms. A novel H2-infused, nitric oxide producing beverage, Hydro Shot, may have important neuroprotective benefits for TBIs. We report preliminary indications that Hydro Shot may be a meaningful adjuvant treatment for TBIs.

Hydrogen has been reported to alleviate early brain injury (EBI) through oxidative stress injury, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and autophagy. Autophagy is a programmed cell death mechanism that plays a vital role in neuronal cell death after SAH. However, the precise role of autophagy in hydrogen-mediated neuroprotection following SAH has not been confirmed. Methods: In the present study, the objective was to investigate the neuroprotective effects and potential molecular mechanisms of hydrogen-rich saline in SAH-induced EBI by regulating neural autophagy in the C57BL/6 mice model. Mortality, neurological score, brain water content, ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA), and neuronal death were evaluated. Results: The results show that hydrogen-rich saline treatment markedly increased the survival rate and neurological score, increased neuron survival, downregulated the autophagy protein expression of Beclin-1 and LC3, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. That indicates that hydrogen-rich saline-mediated inhibition of autophagy and ER stress ameliorate neuronal death after SAH. The neuroprotective capacity of hydrogen-rich saline is partly dependent on the ROS/Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that hydrogen-rich saline improves neurological outcomes in mice and reduces neuronal death by protecting against neural autophagy and ER stress.

Our previous studies have proven that 2% molecular hydrogen (H2) inhalation remain a protective effect on a septic animal model via its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis properties. This current research aims to observe the therapeutic effect of high concentration hydrogen (67%, HCH) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced acute lung injury (ALI), and further investgate the role of Nrf2 signaling pathway. Methods: ALI model was induced by LPS areosol inhalation. HCH were treated for 1 h at 1 and 6 h after modelling. Lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected 4 and 24 h after the exposure of LPS. The histological scores, wet/dry weight ratios, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, protein content and cytokine levels in BALF, apoptosis condition of lung cells, expression of Nrf2 and NF-κB were assessed in both wild type and Nrf2-knockout mice. Results: HCH Inhalation significantly alleviated LPS-induced pathological alterations of lung, and reduced the protein concentration, the wet/dry weight ratio, and the MPO activity of lung tissue. HCH Inhalation improved LPS-induced increasement in caspase-3 activity and the number of TUNEL-positive cells. HCH inhalation attenuated the LPS induced increased total cell content and polymorphonuclear granulocyte content, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, Nrf2 and NF-κB expression. HCH could not produce protective effct in Nrf2-knockout mice. Conclusion: HCH can effectively alleviate LPS-induced ALI, which may be related to activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and inhibition of inflammatory response and cell apoptosis mediated by NF-κB.

Anastomotic staples are extensively used for wound closure after surgical resection in patients with colorectal tumors. However, the safety of Mg anastomosis implants for intestinal closure and the effect of tumor suppression remain elusive. Here, we used a high-purity Mg staple to study these issues. Based on the results, we found that it has the potential to heal wounds produced after colorectal tumor resection while inhibiting relapse of residual tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. After implantation of Mg staples for 7 weeks in rabbits, the intestinal wound gradually healed with no adverse effects such as leakage or inflammation. Furthermore, the implanted Mg staples inhibit the growth of colorectal tumor cells and block migration to normal organs because of the increased concentration of Mg ions and released hydrogen. Such an antitumor effect is further confirmed by the in vitro cell experiments. Mg significantly induces apoptosis of tumor cells as well as inhibits cell growth and migration. Our work presents a feasible therapeutic opinion to design Mg anastomotic staples to perform wound healing and simultaneously release tumor suppressor elements in vivo to decrease the risk of tumor recurrence and metastasis.

We investigated whether hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) can attenuate myocardial fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and clarified the mechanisms involved. Methods: We examined the effect of HRS and pirfenidone (PFD) on myocardial fibrosis in SHR. Systolic blood pressure, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and heart weight index (HWI) were measured, Masson trichrome staining was performed. We assessed the role of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen I, collagen III, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in myocardium. We detected the concentrations of procollagen type-I C-terminal propeptide (PICP), procollagen type-III N-terminal propeptide (PIIINP), and angiotensin II (AngII) in rat serum. Furthermore, the relative protein levels of the TGFβ/Smad pathway were tested. Results: We discovered that HRS decreases LVMI (P<0.05) and HWI(P<0.05) in vivo. Compared to model group, HRS decreases the level of collagen volume fraction(P<0.0001), collagen I(P<0.001), and collagen III(P<0.001) in myocardium, and Ang II(P<0.05), PICP(P<0.001), and PIIINP(P<0.05) in serum. In addition, HRS down-regulates the expression of MDA(P<0.01), α-SMA(P<0.05), and TIMPs(P<0.05), and increased SOD(P<0.05). Furthermore, HRS down-regulated the expression levels of TGF-β1(P<0.0001), Smad3(P<0.0001), and Smad2/3(P<0.001), but had no effect on Smad7 expression(P>0.05). PFD had similar effect compared with HRS and control group. Conclusions: HRS reduced oxidative stress and improved myocardial collagen content, which may be related to inhibition of the TGF-β signaling pathway.This suggests that HRS is an effective therapeutic strategy for myocardial fibrosis.

Forty older adults (20 women) were randomly allocated in a parallel-group design to receive 0.5 L per day of HRW (15 ppm of hydrogen) or control drink (0 ppm of hydrogen) during a 6-month intervention period. The biomarkers assessed at baseline and 6-month follow up were molecular markers in the blood (DNA and chromosomes, nutrient sensing, protein, and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and mitochondria, cell senescence, inflammation), brain metabolism, cognitive functioning, physical function and body composition, resting blood pressure, facial skin features, sleep outcomes, and health-related quality of life. The mean age, weight, and height of study participants were 76.0 ± 5.6 years, 78.2 ± 16.1 kg, height 167.5 ± 11.5 cm, respectively. A significant treatment vs. time interaction was found for telomere length (P = 0.049), with the length increased after HRW intervention (from 0.99 ± 0.15 at baseline to 1.02 ± 0.26 at follow up) and decreased after drinking control water (from 0.92 ± 0.27 to 0.79 ± 0.15). A marker of DNA methylation (Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2, TET2) expression at 6-month follow-up increased in both groups, yet the degree of elevation was significantly higher in HRW (from 0.81 ± 0.52 at baseline to 1.62 ± 0.66 at follow up) comparing to the control water (from 1.13 ± 0.82 to 1.76 ± 0.87) (P = 0.040). A strong trend for treatment vs. time interaction was found for a degree of DNA methylation (P = 0.166), with the methylation increased in the HRW group (from 120.6 ± 39.8 ng at baseline to 126.6 ± 33.8 ng at follow up) and decreased after taking control water (from 133.6 ± 52.9 ng to 121.2 ± 38.4 ng). HRW was superior to control water to increase brain choline and NAA levels in the left frontal grey matter, brain creatine at the right parietal white matter, and brain NAA at the right parietal mesial grey matter (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between interventions for other outcomes (P > 0.05), except for a significantly improved chair stand performance after HRW intervention compared to the control water (P = 0.01). Owing to pleiotropic mechanisms of hydrogen action, this simple biomedical gas could be recognized as a possible anti-aging agent that tackles several hallmarks of aging, including loss of function and telomere length shortening.

Although molecular hydrogen has antioxidation and anti-inflammatory potency, its effect on the vascular endothelial glycocalyx in heat stroke has not been examined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of hydrogen inhalation on the survival and thickness of the vascular endothelial glycocalyx of rats subjected to heat stroke. Altogether, 98 Wistar rats were assigned to the experiments. A heat-controlled chamber set at 40°C temperature and 60% humidity was used to induce heat stroke. After preparation, the anesthetized rats that underwent the heating process were subjected to an hour of stabilization in which 0%, 2%, or 4% hydrogen gas was inhaled and maintained until the experiment ended. In addition to survival rate assessments, blood samples and left ventricles were collected to evaluate the thickness of the vascular endothelial glycocalyx and relevant biomarkers. The results showed that 2% hydrogen gas significantly improved survival in the heat-stroked rats and partially preserved the thickness of the endothelial glycocalyx. In addition, serum levels of endotoxin, syndecan-1, malondialdehyde, and tumor necrosis factor-α decreased, whereas superoxide dismutase levels increased, indicating that inhalation of 2% hydrogen attenuated the damage to the vascular endothelial glycocalyx through its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.

Sixteen apparently healthy young adults (8 men and 8 women; age 24.0 ± 3.5 years) were allocated in a cross-over design to receive a single-dose drink of HRW (8 ppm), caffeine (50 mg), HRW plus caffeine, or control drink (tap water) in the morning after 24-hr sleep deprivation and 12-hr fasting. The primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline (pre-intervention) and 15-min follow-up. Significantly less time was needed to complete trail-making test after both HRW and HRW plus caffeine compared with the control drink (p < .05). The number of errors in the symbol digit modalities test was significantly lower after drinking HRW or caffeine than control drink (p < .05). Both HRW and caffeine significantly increased the choline-to-creatine ratio in several brain regions (frontal white and gray matter), while HRW and the combination intervention also affected brain metabolism in the paracentral brain. No participants reported any side effects from any intervention. The attention enhancement driven by HRW appears along with changes in brain metabolism. Being generally recognized as a safe intervention, hydrogen could be thus recommended as a novel intervention that upholds attention in stressed conditions, with its metabolic footprint likely different from caffeine.

However, no human periodontitis model has examined the anti-inflammatory effects of H2. In this study, we examined the effects of H2 on Pg LPS-induced secretion of 8 types of inflammation markers in a human periodontitis model using human gingival cells with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Our results demonstrated that Pg LPS increased interleukin (IL) 1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-6 secretion, but H2 significantly suppressed the secretion of both cytokines without cytotoxicity. H2 can suppress the production of IL-1α and IL-6, which are identified as cytokines involved in inflammatory reactions in periodontal disease.

The products of fermentation have been proposed to influence the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) from the many endocrine cells in the colonic epithelium. However, little is known about the colonic contribution to fasting or postprandial plasma levels of L-cell products. Objective: To determine the impact of colonic lactulose fermentation on gut peptide secretion and to evaluate whether colonic endocrine secretion contributes to gut hormone concentrations measurable in the fasting state. Research design and methods: Ten healthy young men were studied on three occasions after an overnight fast. On two study days, lactulose (20 g) was given orally, and compared to water intake on a third study day. For one of the lactulose visits participants underwent a full colonic evacuation. Over a six-hour study protocol, lactulose fermentation was assessed by measuring exhaled hydrogen (H2), while gut peptide secretion, paracetamol and short chain fatty acid levels were measured in plasma. Results: Colonic evacuation markedly reduced hydrogen exhalation after lactulose intake (p=0.013). Our analysis suggests that the colon does not account for the measurable amounts of GLP-1 and PYY present in the circulation during fasting, and that fermentation and peptide secretion are not acutely related. Conclusion: Whether colonic luminal contents affect colonic L-cell secretion sufficiently to influence circulating concentrations requires further investigation. Colonic evacuation markedly reduced lactulose fermentation, but hormone releases were unchanged in the present study.

We investigated the capacities of a hydrogen-enriched water (HW) eliminating carbon nanoparticles (CNP) and carbon microparticles (CMP) from the lungs and blood, respectively. In CNP-elimination test, rats were orally administered with purified water (PW) or HW (10 or 30 mL/kg/day) for 10 weeks. At the time point of 4 weeks, the rats were challenged with intratracheal instillation of CNP (4 mg). CNP accumulated in the airways and alveoli, and induced inflammatory lesions. Such pneumoconiosis was markedly improved by feeding HW, while PW was ineffective. CNP-induced pneumoconiosis caused systemic hematological alterations, decreasing major inflammatory cells, but markedly increasing eosinophils, indicative of an allergic reaction, which were attenuated by treatment with HW. Such PM-eliminating and anti-allergic effects of HW reduced body burden as confirmed from the facilitated recovery of body and lung weights. In CMP-clearance test, mice were orally administered with PW or HW for 7 days, and intravenously injected with CMP (300 mg/kg). CMP was rapidly eliminated from the blood in HW-fed mice. Indeed, the phagocytic indices increased to 3.5 and 6.7 folds at 10 and 30 mL/kg of HW, in comparison with a negligible effect of PW.

We have established a corresponding mouse model and examined the function of hydrogen inhalation on lung pathology and pulmonary edema induced by LPS, as well as contents of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-8. The pulmonary microvascular permeability and 66.7 % hydrogen on the expression of sirt1 and its downstream signaling molecules were tested. Results showed that 66.7 % hydrogen alleviated lung pathological changes and pulmonary edema caused by LPS, and reduced the degree of ALI by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine release and oxidative stress response, thereby decreasing the expression of molecules related to intercellular adhesion. sirt1 contributed to the repair of LPS-induced ALI by hydrogen through the regulation of NF-κB and catalase expression.

Reactive oxygen species is one of the many factors that induce and worsen the development of such diseases, and it can be targeted by hydrogen treatment. This study examined the effect of molecular hydrogen in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, which is emerging as a novel therapeutic agent for various diseases. Methods: Ischemia-reperfusion injury was generated through bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in C57BL/6 mice. The test group received hydrogen-rich water orally during the test period. To confirm model establishment and the effect of hydrogen treatment, behavioural tests, biochemical assays, immunofluorescence microscopy, and cytokine assays were conducted. Results: Open field and novel object recognition tests revealed that the hydrogen-treated group had improved cognitive function and anxiety levels compared to the nontreated group, while hematoxylin and eosin stain showed abundant pyknotic cells in a model mouse brain, and this was attenuated in the hydrogen-treated mouse brain. Total antioxidant capacity and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assays revealed that hydrogen treatment induced antioxidative effects in the mouse brain. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed attenuated apoptosis in the striatum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus of hydrogen-treated mice. Western blotting showed that hydrogen treatment reduced Bax and TNFα levels. Finally, cytokine assays showed that IL-2 and IL-10 levels significantly differed between the hydrogen-treated and nontreated groups. Conclusion: Hydrogen treatment could potentially be a future therapeutic strategy for ischemia and its derived neurodegenerative diseases by improving cognitive abilities and inducing antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects. Hydrogen treatment also decreased Bax and TNFα levels and induced an anti-inflammatory response via regulation of IL-2 and IL-10. These results will serve as a milestone for future studies intended to reveal the mechanism of action of molecular hydrogen in neurodegenerative diseases.

While it is known that oxidative stress is closely associated with aging, the beneficial effect of H2 on oxidative stress-related aging is still unclear. In this study, a mouse model of D-galactose-induced aging was employed to investigate the protective effects of H2. Methods: The mice were administrated of H2 via different routes (4% H2 inhalation, H2-rich water drinking, and H2-rich saline injection), the aging-related biomarkers in plasma and the oxidative stress in different tissues were measured. Results: The results showed that H2 improved aging-related biomarkers, ie, total antioxidant capacity, advanced glycation end products, tumor necrosis factor-α, free fatty acids, and alanine aminotransferase in plasma. Furthermore, H2 alleviated oxidative stress in the liver, brain, and heart by reducing the levels of lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde and increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase. In addition, it seems that 4% H2 inhalation was the most effective regarding the amount of H2 taken up and in reducing the markers of oxidative stress in some of the tissues; however, the other routes of administration resulted in the same efficacy in most indicators. Conclusion: H2 can prevent oxidative stress in D-galactose-induced aging mice when administered by different routes.

A supplementation of exogenous antioxidants can reduce the total amount of ROS during exercise while it may also affect the ROS' role in the signaling pathways of mitochondrial biogenesis. It has been suggested that hydrogen gas, as an antioxidant, can selectively scavenge hydroxyl radicals but does not affect superoxide anion's signal transduction. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 1-h hydrogen gas inhalation 30min prior to a treadmill exercise on the key biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis and related signaling pathways, and the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, with those of vitamin C, in the rat skeletal muscle. Eighty-one 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to three interventions (exercise-only, exercise+4%H2, and exercise+vitamin C at 500mg/kg weight, with 27 rats under each intervention), and sampled at pre-, immediately post and 4h post a 60-min treadmill exercise at speed of 27m/min and flat inclination, with nine rats in each sub-group. Expression of mitochondrial biogenetic markers and related signaling molecules in gastrocnemius muscle, and concentrations of oxidative stress markers in serum were measured. Two-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis analyses showed that both hydrogen inhalation and vitamin C supplementation significantly reduced serum levels of MDA immediately after exercise and AGEs 4h after exercise. The pre-exercise supplement of vitamin C significantly reduced mitochondrial complex IV concentrations and PGC-1α, NRF-1, TFAM gene expression levels compared to the pre-exercise group, but the hydrogen gas intervention did not result in a reduction in these measurements. Unlike vitamin C, hydrogen inhalation did not blunt post-exercise mitochondrial biogenetic signals, but resulted in an increase in complex IV concentration, activation of PGC-1α, and TFAM and NRF-2 gene transcription, and up-regulation of PGC-1α protein expression. The findings indicated that hydrogen gas inhalation could play the role as an effective antioxidant in response to the exercise, whilst it did not significantly affect mitochondrial biogenesis. The dose-response relationship and antioxidant effects in different types of exercise for hydrogen inhalation require further investigation.

Different concentrations of mercury chloride (H1: 5 µg/mL, H2: 10 µg/mL, H3: 20 µg/mL, H4: 40 µg/mL, and C1: control) and mercury chloride prepared in hydrogen-rich water (H5: 5 µg/mL, H6: 10 µg/mL, H7: 20 µg/mL, H8: 40 µg/mL, and C2: control) were injected into earthworms. The changes and reductions in some bands representing proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides (3280 cm-1, 2922 cm-1, 2855 cm-1, 1170 cm-1, and 1047 cm-1) showed that protective effects could occur in groups prepared with hydrogen-rich water. In the FTIR results, it was found that these bands in the H3 group were more affected and decreased by the influence of mercury on earthworms than the H7 group prepared with hydrogen. LC-MS analysis showed that the changes in some ions of the highest dose groups (H4 and H8) were different, and mercury caused oxidative DNA damage in earthworms. When the high-level application groups of mercury, i.e., H4 and H8 were compared with the controls, the ion exchange ([M + H] + ; m/z 283.1) representing the 8-Oxo-dG level in earthworms was higher in the H4 group than the H8 group. This reveals that HRW exhibited the potential ability to alleviate the toxic effects of mercury; however, a longer period of HRW treatment may be necessary to distinguish an obvious effect. The ATR-FTIR spectroscopy provided a rapid and precise method for monitoring the changes in biological tissues caused by a toxic compound at the molecular level.

Persistent inflammation results in irreversible alveolar fibrosis. Because hydrogen gas possesses anti-inflammatory properties, we hypothesized that daily repeated inhalation of hydrogen gas could suppress persistent lung inflammation by inducing functional changes in macrophages, and consequently inhibit lung fibrosis during late-phase lung injury. Methods: To test this hypothesis, lung injury was induced in mice by intratracheal administration of bleomycin (1.0 mg/kg). Mice were exposed to control gas (air) or hydrogen (3.2% in air) for 6 h every day for 7 or 21 days. Respiratory physiology, tissue pathology, markers of inflammation, and macrophage phenotypes were examined. Results: Mice with bleomycin-induced lung injury that received daily hydrogen therapy for 21 days (BH group) exhibited higher static compliance (0.056 mL/cmH2O, 95% CI 0.047-0.064) than mice with bleomycin-induced lung injury exposed only to air (BA group; 0.042 mL/cmH2O, 95% CI 0.031-0.053, p = 0.02) and lower static elastance (BH 18.8 cmH2O/mL, [95% CI 15.4-22.2] vs. BA 26.7 cmH2O/mL [95% CI 19.6-33.8], p = 0.02). When the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were examined 7 days after bleomycin administration, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-4 and IL-13 were significantly lower in the BH group than in the BA group. There were significantly fewer M2-biased macrophages in the alveolar interstitium of the BH group than in the BA group (3.1% [95% CI 1.6-4.5%] vs. 1.1% [95% CI 0.3-1.8%], p = 0.008).

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) has become the main life-threatening complication and cause of death in later stage postallo-HSCT. Current treatment options for cGVHD are limited. Hydrogen gas (H2) has been demonstrated that has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrosis effects. The aim of this study was to confirm whether oral administration hydrogen-rich water exerted therapeutic effects on a scleroderma cGVHD mouse model and tried to explain the mechanism underly it. Methods: A mouse cGVHD model was established by haploidentical bone marrow transplantation. To evaluate therapeutic effects of H2 on cGVHD, survival rate, changes in clinical scores, and skin pathologic characteristics of cGVHD mice were observed. To evaluate its therapeutic mechanism, we detected the expression levels of antioxidative enzymes heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) and NAD (P)H: quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1(NQO1) in skin homogenates. We also detected the expression level of the apoptotic protein caspase-3 in skin homogenates. Results: 1-month survival rate of cGVHD mice in the hydrogen group reached 93.3%, significantly higher than 66.7% in the nonhydrogen group (p < 0.05). Clinical score of cGVHD mice was improved by hydrogen-rich water at 96 days posttransplantation (2.2 versus 4.5, p < 0.05). The skin pathological condition of cGVHD mice was significantly improved by hydrogen-rich water. At 96 days posttransplantation, average skin pathological hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining score in the hydrogen group was 1.05, which was significantly lower than 3.2 in the nonhydrogen group (p < 0.01). Average Masson staining score was 0.6 point in the hydrogen group, lower than 0.9 point in the nonhydrogen group (p < 0.05). Both the relative expression levels of HO-1 and NQO1 proteins in skin specimens of cGVHD mice in the hydrogen group were lower than that in the nonhydrogen group (2.47 versus 6.21 and 1.83 versus 3.59, p < 0.05). The relative expression level of caspase-3 protein in skin specimens of cGVHD mice increased to 7.17 on the 96th day after transplantation, significantly higher than 4.36 in the hydrogen group. Conclusion: In this study, we found that oral hydrogen-rich water improved the survival rate and clinical symptoms of cGVHD mice by antioxidant and antiapoptosis. This study would pave the way for further clinical study, which may provide a new treatment option for cGVHD.

Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups, including normal diet group, and diabetes model (DM) group, DM + metformin treatment (DMM) group, DMM + hypoxia treatment (DMMH) group and DMMH + hydrogenrich water (DMMHR) group. We found that the levels of lactic acid, pyruvate and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly lower in the blood of DMMHR group than DMMH group. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels in liver and heart were significantly higher in DMMH group after hydrogen-rich water treatment, while malondialdehyde and oxidized glutathione levels were decreased in DMMHR group when compared with DMMH group, which indicates that hydrogen-rich water could reduce oxidative stress. qPCR analysis demonstrated that that pro-apoptotic genes Bax/Caspase-3 were upregulated in DM group and metformin treatment suppressed their upregulation (DMM group). However, hypoxic condition reversed the effect of metformin on apoptotic gene expression, and hydrogen-rich water showed little effect on these genes under hypoxia. HE staining showed that hydrogen-rich water prevented myocardial fiber damages under hypoxia. In summary, we conclude that hydrogen-rich water could prevent lactate accumulation and reduce oxidant stress in diabetic rat model to prevent hypoxia-induced damages. It could be served as a potential agent for diabetes patients with metformin treatment to prevent lactic acidosis and reduce myocardial damages under hypoxic conditions.

Animal studies have reported that hydrogen gas inhalation helped alleviate cerebral and cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injuries. In humans, hydrogen inhalation therapy is presently approved as a treatment under Advanced Medical Care B in Japan (jRCTs031180352: limited to adult patients who suffered out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and are in a continuous coma) and its effectiveness is being examined in a clinical trial. The Japanese government has introduced the 'Advanced Medical Care System' to promote the development of drugs and devices under governmental regulations. Advanced Medical Care B is a system designed for unapproved or off-label drugs or medical technologies used in a clinical trial setting. Hepatectomy is generally performed with repeated hepatic blood-flow occlusion and then reperfusion (ischemia and reperfusion). No report, however, has been made on ROS inhibition by hydrogen inhalation therapy or its effectiveness in post-hepatectomy patients. Hydrogen gas inhalation in the early stages after hepatectomy is anticipated to inhibit liver dysfunction by inhibiting ROS. Methods and analysis: This study is a randomized, controlled, double-blind superiority trial, which will be conducted as a 'specified clinical trial' in accordance with the Clinical Trials Act in Japan. Trial registration was prospectively completed before the first participant was enrolled. The subjects will be patients who will undergo hepatectomy and will be allocated randomly into group A with hydrogen gas inhalation or group B with air inhalation after hepatectomy. The study will examine if hydrogen gas inhalation improves QOL of post-hepatectomy patients. The primary endpoint is patient QOL (score of a 40-item quality of recovery questionnaire, QoR40) on postoperative day 3 and the secondary endpoints are QoR40s besides that on postoperative day 3, grade of postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo score), level of pain (Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)), amount of dietary intake, liver function, inflammation level, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (urinary 8-OHdG) level, and number of pedometer-assessed steps.

Tradition deep diving with helium is limited by 2 Factor: – High Pressure Nervous syndrome (HENS) that causes Motricity disorders beyond 300 meters. – Gas density that impairs pulmonary ventilation. Hydrogen should extend these limits thanks to its Narcotic potency that has an antagonistic effect on the HPNS syndrome and thanks to its light molecular mass. HYDRAV, first hydrogen experimental saturation dive, was successfully performed. All the equipment and techniques especially developed to use hydrogen have proved entirely satisfactory. From the biomedical standpoint the improvement with reference to Heliox is outstanding: – No High Pressure nervous Syndrome, – Easier breathing. The very promising results of HYDRAV will hopefully lead to quick offshore industrial applications. Hydrogen will enable divers to work in water depths Ranging from 400 to 600 meter and certainly beyond. INTRODUCTION: For more than 20 years now, all deep commercial Dives have been carried out using breathing mixtures Made up essentially of helium and oxygen. Helium has allowed the professional diver to work on the continental shelf area down to depths of 300 meters. In this range, equipments and methods are now relatively well established. However, in spite of its remarkable qualities helium alone cannot be the vector of oxygen in breathing mixtures beyond a certain depth. Indeed, deep divers must cope with 2 limiting Factors: – The High Pressure Nervous Syndrome(HPNS), linked to the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the central nervous system. These appear in the 250 /300 meter range and increase with depth, Causing motor disturbance that may seriously Impairs work efficiency. – The density of breathing mixtures, which increases proportionally to pressure, demands a subsequent increase in breathing efforts, which hinders work capacity. The following countermeasure may be proposed: – The effects of pressure can be reduced by adding to the breathing mixture a given amount of narcotic as (helium is not). – Gas density can be reduced by using a vector that has a lower molecular mass than helium. Hydrogen is the only gas that satisfies both these criteria. Because of the progress in the search and exploitation of deep offshore oilfields, C0OMEX decided to launch a new program for developing hydrogen diving. Experiment have been carried out both at sea and at Its research center in Marseille. – Hydra III- June1$&x dives at sea at depths of 75 and 91 meters. – Hydra IV - November 1983: chamber dives at depths of 120,150,183,240and 300 meter. – Hydra V - May and June 1985: chamber saturation Dives at 450 meters.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. Our previous work has shown that 42% H2 can improve TBI. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that inhalation of hydrogen (42% H2, 21% O2, balanced nitrogen) for 1 h per day can improve TBI-induced ALI. Methods: Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. Except for the sham group (group S), rats were subjected to a fluid percussion injury (FPI) and the H2 treatment group were given inhaled hydrogen for 1 h per day. We evaluated the lung function, pyroptosis and apoptosis at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Results: Compared with group S, the rats in the TBI group (group T) showed obvious pulmonary edema after a TBI. Inhalation of high-concentration hydrogen significantly improved the rats. During this process, rats had some tendency to heal on their own, and H2 also accelerated the self-healing process. Lung injury scores, oxygenation index and pulmonary edema were consistent. Compared with group S, the pyroptosis-related proteins Caspase-1, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) and Gasdermin-D (GSDM-D) in the lung tissues of the rats in group T were significantly increased after a TBI. In the H2 treatment group (group H), these proteins were significantly decreased. The levels of IL-1β and IL-18 were significantly increased after TBI while in group H were significantly decreased. At the same time, cleaved caspase-3 and BCL-2/Bax were also changed after H2 treatment. These demonstrates the powerful ameliorating effect of H2 on pyroptosis, apoptosis and systemic inflammation. However, rats also had tendency to heal on their own, and H2 also accelerated the self-healing process at the same time. Conclusions: H2 improves TBI-ALI, and the mechanism may be due to the decrease of both pyroptosis and apoptosis and the alleviation of inflammation. These findings provide a reference and evidence for the use of H2 in TBI-ALI patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The HW bath apparatus supplied nano-bubbles with a diameter of 110 ± 10 nm and 338-682 μg/L of dissolved hydrogen after 120 minutes electrolysis, and nano-bubbles increased to 9.91 × 107/mL along with the increase of correlative dissolved hydrogen. Ten-minute HW bath increased the oxygen radical absorption-based antioxidant capacity to 110.9 ± 9.2% at post-bathing 120 minutes, although unaltered with 10-minute normal water bath at 40°C in healthy subjects. The CRP level was repressed to 70.2 ± 12.1% at 120 minutes after HW bath, although rather increased for normal water bath. In the patients with connective tissue diseases, the CRP level was repressed to 3-24% upon 9 days to 4 months of HW bathing.

Due to difficulties in measuring hydrogen concentration in vivo after intake and high explosive risks of hydrogen, studies about dose-response relationships and tissue concentrations of hydrogen are few. Here, for the first time, we monitored real-time hydrogen concentrations in different tissues in rats including brain, liver, spleen, kidney, thigh muscle, inguinal white adipose tissue, and gonadal white adipose tissue after inhaling different concentrations of hydrogen (4%, 42%, and 67%) using an electrochemical sensor. Hydrogen concentrations in the same tissue showed a dose-dependent response. The equilibrium concentration values were highest in the brain and lowest in the thigh muscle. The saturation and desaturation curves changed more slowly in the thigh muscle and white adipose tissues than in other tissues. These results provide fundamental information for the selection of hydrogen dose applications in basic research and clinical trials.

Although many studies have shown efficacy of drinking H2-rich water in neuropsychiatric and endocrine metabolic disorders, their authenticity has been questioned because none examined the associated pharmacokinetics of H2. Therefore, we performed the first study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of H2 in pigs given an H2-rich glucose solution with the aim to extrapolate the findings to humans. We inserted blood collection catheters into the jejunal and portal veins, suprahepatic inferior vena cava, and carotid artery of 4 female pigs aged 8 weeks. Then, within 2 min we infused 500 ml of either H2-rich or H2-free glucose solution into the jejunum via a percutaneous gastrostomy tube and measured changes in H2 concentration in venous and arterial blood over 120 min. After infusion of the H2-rich glucose solution, H2 concentration in the portal vein peaked at 0.05 mg/L and remained at more than 0.016 mg/L (H2 saturation level, 1%) after 1 h; it also increased after infusion of H2-free glucose solution but remained below 0.001 mg/L (H2 saturation level, 0.06%). We assume that H2 was subsequently metabolized in the liver or eliminated via the lungs because it was not detected in the carotid artery. In conclusion, drinking highly concentrated H2-rich solution within a short time is a good way to increase H2 concentration in portal blood and supply H2 to the liver.

Inhalation of hydrogen gas and oral ingestion of hydrogen-rich saline are two common systemic routes of hydrogen administration. We have developed a topical delivery method of hydrogen at targeted sites through the degradation of magnesium-based biomaterials. However, the underlying mechanism of hydrogen's role in cancer treatment remains ambiguous. Here, we investigate the mechanism of tumor cell apoptosis triggered by the hydrogen released from magnesium-based biomaterials. We find that the localized release of hydrogen increases the expression level of P53 tumor suppressor proteins, as demonstrated by the in vitro RNA sequencing and protein expression analysis. Then, the P53 proteins disrupt the membrane potential of mitochondria, activate autophagy, suppress the reactive oxygen species in cancer cells, and finally result in tumor suppression. The anti-tumor efficacy of magnesium-based biomaterials is further validated in vivo by inserting magnesium wire into the subcutaneous tumor in a mouse. We also discovered that the minimal hydrogen concentration from magnesium wires to trigger substantial tumor apoptosis is 91.2 μL/mm3 per day, which is much lower than that required for hydrogen inhalation. Taken together, these findings reveal the release of H2 from magnesium-based biomaterial exerts its anti-tumoral activity by activating the P53-mediated lysosome-mitochondria apoptosis signaling pathway, which strengthens the therapeutic potential of this biomaterial as localized anti-tumor treatment.

Eight circular wounds were analyzed in each dog. The experimental group was treated with HRW thrice daily, while the control group was provided with distilled water (DW). The wound tissues of dogs were examined histopathologically. The fibroblasts, inflammatory cell infiltration, the average number of new blood vessels, and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the skin homogenate of the wound was measured using the corresponding kits. The expressions of Nrf-2, HO-1, NQO-1, VEGF, and PDGF were measured using the real-time fluorescence quantitative method. We observed that HRW wounds showed an increased rate of wound healing, and a faster average healing time compared with DW. Histopathology showed that in the HRW group, the average thickness of the epidermis was significantly lower than the DW group. The average number of blood vessels in the HRW group was higher than the DW group. The MDA levels were higher in the DW group than in the HRW group, but the SOD levels were higher in the HRW group than in the DW group. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the expression of each gene was significantly different between the two groups.

This study explored the effect and mechanism of molecular hydrogen in chronic UC. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 mice (19.6 ​± ​0.4 ​g, 7 weeks) were randomly divided into 3 groups: normal control (NC) group, UC (Dextran Sulfate Sodium, DSS) group, and hydrogen-rich water (HRW, 0.8 ​ppm)-treated UC (DSS ​+ ​HRW) group. Mice in the DSS treatment group were treated with DSS for the following 3 cycles to establish chronic UC model: the first 2 cycles consisted of 2.5% DSS for 5 days, followed by drinking water for 16 days, and a third cycle consisted of 2% DSS for 4 days, followed by drinking water for 10 days. The mice in the DSS ​+ ​HRW group were administered HRW daily throughout the experiment. Results: The mice in the DSS groups developed typical clinical signs of colitis. HRW treatment partially ameliorated colitis symptoms, improved histopathological changes, significantly increased glutathione (GSH) concentration and decreased TNF-α level. Notably, HRW treatment significantly inhibited the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis (P ​< ​0.05 vs. DSS group), with the relative abundance that was close to the levels in the NC group. Microarray analysis revealed that 252 genes were significantly modified after HRW treatment compared with those in the DSS treatment alone group, and 17 genes were related to inflammation, including 9 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).

There is currently no pharmacological treatment that has been proven to improve outcomes after CA/ECPR. We aimed to test the hypothesis that administration of hydrogen gas (H2) combined with ECPR could improve outcomes after CA/ECPR in rats. Methods: Rats were subjected to 20 min of asphyxial CA and were resuscitated by ECPR. Mechanical ventilation (MV) was initiated at the beginning of ECPR. Animals were randomly assigned to the placebo or H2 gas treatment groups. The supplement gas was administered with O2 through the ECMO membrane and MV. Survival time, electroencephalography (EEG), brain functional status, and brain tissue oxygenation were measured. Changes in the plasma levels of syndecan-1 (a marker of endothelial damage), multiple cytokines, chemokines, and metabolites were also evaluated. Results: The survival rate at 4 h was 77.8% (7 out of 9) in the H2 group and 22.2% (2 out of 9) in the placebo group. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that H2 significantly improved the 4 h-survival endpoint (log-rank P = 0.025 vs. placebo). All animals treated with H2 regained EEG activity, whereas no recovery was observed in animals treated with placebo. H2 therapy markedly improved intra-resuscitation brain tissue oxygenation and prevented an increase in central venous pressure after ECPR. H2 attenuated an increase in syndecan-1 levels and enhanced an increase in interleukin-10, vascular endothelial growth factor, and leptin levels after ECPR. Metabolomics analysis identified significant changes at 2 h after CA/ECPR between the two groups, particularly in D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism. Conclusions: H2 therapy improved mortality in highly lethal CA rats rescued by ECPR and helped recover brain electrical activity. The underlying mechanism might be linked to protective effects against endothelial damage. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of H2 on ischemia-reperfusion injury in critically ill patients who require ECMO support.

The preventive and therapeutic effects of H2 on various pathological processes have been intensively investigated in numerous clinical trials; it is commonly believed that the beneficial effects are mainly attributed to its selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Lee et al., 2015; Ohta, 2015; LeBaron et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2020). In recent years, a handful of rodent studies revealed that exogenous H2 can affect the gut microbiota (Sha et al., 2018; Valdes et al., 2018). For example, H2 was reported to induce a higher abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (Bordoni et al., 2019). Recent first-in-human trials have explored the effects of the long-term consumption of H2-rich water on antioxidant activity and the gut flora (Sha et al., 2018; Suzuki et al., 2018). Although these promising results suggest that the intestinal microbiota may be another plausible target for molecular H2, more studies are highly warranted to explain the mechanism(s) of H2 action on bacterial growth and functions.

Hydrogen gas provides potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). This study observed the effects of hydrogen inhalation on lung grafts during the warm ischemia phase in cardiac death donors. Methods: After cardiac death, rat donor lungs (n = 8) underwent mechanical ventilation with 40% oxygen plus 60% nitrogen (control group) or 3% hydrogen and 40% oxygen plus 57% nitrogen (hydrogen group) for 2 h during the warm ischemia phase in situ.

Studies have suggested that H2-enriched saline/water alleviates colitis in murine models; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Despite evidence demonstrating the importance of the microbial hydrogen economy, which reflects the balance between H2-producing (hydrogenogenic) and H2-utilizing (hydrogenotrophic) microbes in maintaining colonic mucosal ecosystems, minimal efforts have been exerted to manipulate relevant H2-microbe interactions for colonic health. Consistent with previous studies, we found that administration of hydrogen-rich saline (HS) ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis in a mouse model. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HS administration can increase the abundance of intestinal-specific short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and SCFA production, thereby activating the intracellular butyrate sensor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ signaling and decreasing the epithelial expression of Nos2, consequently promoting the recovery of the colonic anaerobic environment. Our results also indicated that HS administration ameliorated disrupted intestinal barrier functions by modulating specific mucosa-associated mucolytic bacteria, leading to substantial inhibition of opportunistic pathogenic Escherichia coli expansion as well as a significant increase in the expression of interepithelial tight junction proteins and a decrease in intestinal barrier permeability in mice with colitis. Exogenous H2 reprograms colonocyte metabolism by regulating the H2-gut microbiota-SCFAs axis and strengthens the intestinal barrier by modulating specific mucosa-associated mucolytic bacteria, wherein improved microbial hydrogen economy alleviates colitis.",Positive,Mouse,Intestine,Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),Colitis,Gas,N/A,In Vivo Biotic Production,,,China

Although hydrogen gas (H2) exerts excellent neuroprotective effects in patients with ICH, there are sex-based differences in H2 efficacy in several diseases. Herein, we determined whether estrogen increases susceptibility to the neuroprotective effects of H2 in males with ICH-induced depression. Methods: A rodent model of ICH in the basal ganglia was established using autologous blood injection (30 μL). Mice were treated with 2.9% H2 for 2 h daily for 3 days post-ICH. Estrogen (1 mg/kg) was administered by subcutaneous injection daily for 3 days to male mice post-ICH. Thirty days post-ICH, PSD was evaluated by sucrose preference, forced swimming, and 3-chamber social tests.

Results: Compared with female mice, H2 administration post-ICH exhibited fewer neuroprotective effects, including decreased sucrose consumption and time spent sniffing a novel mouse, increased immobility time, downregulated total SOD content, upregulated ROS content and p-NF-κB levels, and elevated astrocyte branches, whereas estrogen enhanced the neuroprotective effects of H2 in male mice. A reduced number of p-NF-κB-positive astrocytes, downregulated expression of p-NF-κB, p-IKKβ, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the amygdala were demonstrated in ICH-males treated with estrogen plus H2.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of hydrogen (H2) gas inhalation in trimethyltin (TMT)-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction in the C57BL/6 mice. First, mice were divided into the following groups: mice without TMT injection (NC), TMT-only injection group (TMT only), TMT injection + lithium chloride-treated group as a positive control (PC), and TMT injection + 2% H2 inhalation-treated group (H2). The TMT injection groups were administered a single dosage of intraperitoneal TMT injection (2.6 mg/kg body weight) and the H2 group was treated with 2% H2 for 30 min once a day for four weeks. Additionally, a behavioral test was performed with Y-maze to test the cognitive abilities of the mice. Furthermore, multiple OS- and AD-related biomarkers such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), calcium (Ca2+), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase, inflammatory cytokines, apolipoprotein E (Apo-E), amyloid β (Aβ)-40, phospho-tau (p-tau), Bcl-2, and Bcl-2- associated X (Bax) were investigated in the blood and brain. Our results demonstrated that TMT exposure alters seizure and spatial recognition memory. However, after H2 treatment, memory deficits were ameliorated. H2 treatment also decreased AD-related biomarkers, such as Apo-E, Aβ-40, p-tau, and Bax and OS markers such as ROS, NO, Ca2+, and MDA in both serum and brain. In contrast, catalase and GPx activities were significantly increased in the TMT-only group and decreased after H2 gas treatment in serum and brain. In addition, inflammatory cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were found to be significantly decreased after H2 treatment in both serum and brain lysates. In contrast, Bcl-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression levels were found to be enhanced after H2 treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrated that 2% H2 gas inhalation in TMT-treated mice exhibits memory enhancing activity and decreases the AD, OS, and inflammatory-related markers. Therefore, H2 might be a candidate for repairing neurodegenerative diseases with cognitive dysfunction.

Induction of neuroprotection is a crucial therapeutic strategy for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). Hydrogen has neuroprotective effects against brain-related diseases. Inflammation and oxidative stress are the two main pathophysiological mechanisms in neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic injury. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an endogenous redox-sensitive transcription factor that participates in the antioxidant defence system through its effects on inflammation and oxidative stress. Herein, the research focuses on the mechanisms by which Nrf2 participates in the protection of hydrogen against HIE. The model of HIE was established by ligation of the right carotid artery and hypoxia in wild-type (WT) and Nrf2-/- mice. First, Nrf2 pathway activity was detected after hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) followed or not by hydrogen treatment. Brain injury, apoptosis, the inflammatory response, oxidative stress injury, and learning and memory function were assayed. We found that HI induced Nrf2 expression and signalling activation. Hydrogen alleviated the infarction volume, brain water content, neurological scores, apoptosis and long-term learning and memory functions after HI in WT mice but not in Nrf2-/- mice. Moreover, the oxidative products reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were reduced and the antioxidant enzymes Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) were upregulated by hydrogen treatment after HI in WT mice, but not in Nrf2-/- mice. In addition, the absence of Nrf2 abolished the suppressive effect of hydrogen on the expression of Nacht, Lrr, and Pyd domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) pathway members and p65 NF-κB after HI.

Hydrogen, which is a slight and specific cytotoxic oxygen radical scavenger, has been demonstrated to ameliorate early brain injury (EBI) through reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress injury, apoptosis and necroptosis. Necroptosis refers to a type of programmed cell death process that has a vital function in neuronal cell death following TBI. The specific function of necroptosis in hydrogen-mediated neuroprotection after TBI, however, has yet to be determined. The present study aimed to examine the neuroprotective effects and possible molecular basis that underly hydrogen-rich saline in TBI-stimulated EBI by examining neural necroptosis in the C57BL/6 mouse model. The brain water content, neurological score, neuroinflammatory cytokines (NF-κΒ, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) and ROS were evaluated using flow cytometry. Malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) levels were evaluated using a biochemical kit. Receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP)1, RIP3, Nrf2 and Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were evaluated using western blotting. mRNA of Nrf2 and HO-1 were evaluated using quantitative PCR. Neuronal death was evaluated by TUNEL staining. The outcomes illustrated that hydrogen-rich saline treatment considerably enhanced the neurological score, increased neuronal survival, decreased the levels of serum MDA and brain ROS, increased the levels of serum GSH and SOD. In addition the protein expression levels of RIP1 and RIP3 and the cytokines NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were downregulated compared with the TBI group, which demonstrated that hydrogen-rich saline-induced inhibition of necroptosis and neuroinflammation ameliorated neuronal death following TBI. The neuroprotective capacity of hydrogen-rich saline was demonstrated to be partly dependent on the ROS/heme oxygenase-1 signaling pathway. Taken together, the findings of the present study indicated that hydrogen-rich saline enhanced neurological outcomes in mice and minimized neuronal death by inducing protective effects against neural necroptosis as well as neuroinflammation.

However, lactate levels decreased significantly in the EHW group, and this decrease was significantly correlated with a reduction in HOMA-IR, fasting plasma glucose, and fasting plasma insulin level. Serum lactate level also significantly correlated to decreased insulin bolus secretion after 90 min with glucose loading in the EHW subjects with HOMA-IR > 1.73. No EHW treatment-related adverse effects were observed. Conclusion: There were no significant effect of EHW in the change in HOMA-IR in this study; larger-scale and longer-term study are needed to verify the effects of EHW in T2DM patients.

Tumor removal remains the preferred frontline treatment; however, effective non-surgical interventions remain a high priority. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely used chemotherapy agent, and molecular hydrogen (H2) has been recognized for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, with research also suggesting its potential anti-tumor effects. Therefore, H2 dissolved in water [hydrogen-rich water (HRW)], with or without 5-FU, may present itself as a novel therapeutic for CRC. Aim: To investigate the effects of HRW, with or without 5-FU, as a novel therapeutic for CRC. Methods: CRC was induced in the left flank of inbred Balb/c mice. A total of 24 mice bearing tumors were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6 per group) and treated as follows: (1) Control group; (2) 5-FU group that received intraperitoneal injection of 5-FU (5 mg/kg) every other day; (3) H2 group that received HRW, created and delivered via dissolving the H2-generating tablet in the animals' drinking water, with 200 μL also delivered by oral gavage; and (4) The combination group, H2 (administered in same way as for group three) combined with 5-FU administered same way as group two. Results: Administration of HRW + 5-FU significantly improved tumor weight, tumor size, collagen content and fibrosis as compared to the CRC control group. Specifically, HRW attenuated oxidative stress (OS) and potentiated antioxidant activity (AA), whereas 5-FU treatment exacerbated OS and blunted AA. The combination of HRW + 5-FU significantly reduced tumor weight and size, as well as reduced collagen deposition and the degree of fibrosis, while further increasing OS and decreasing AA compared to administration of 5-FU alone. Conclusion: Administration of HRW, with or without 5-FU, may serve as a therapeutic for treating CRC.",Positive,Mouse,Intestine,Cancer,Novel Therapy,Water (Dissolved),Alkaline,Ingestion,,,Iran

The underlying causes are uncontrolled inflammatory reactions and intractable hypoxemia, which are difficult to control and improve. In the past 10 years, gas medical studies have found that both hydrogen molecules and oxygen molecules have protective effects on acute lung injury by improving inflammatory reactions and hypoxia, respectively. Oxygen is an oxidant and hydrogen is an antioxidant. In this study, we investigated the combined effect of above two-gas molecular on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced acute lung injury. Methods: To clarify whether the combination of hydrogen and oxygen could increase or cancel out the protective effect, an ALI mice model induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS was established, and the degree of lung tissue and mitochondria damage was evaluated based on the pathological sections, inflammatory factors, wet-dry ratio, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, western blotting and other detection methods also used to evaluate the therapeutic effect on acute lung injury model. Results: We observed that the combined protective effect of hydrogen and oxygen was superior to their respective protective effects, and the specific molecular mechanisms of the two therapies might be different. Conclusion: Hydrogen plays a more important role in the inflammatory and anti-apoptosis mechanisms, while oxygen improves hypoxia of the body, and thus, its molecular mechanism may be closely associated to the hypoxia pathways.",Positive,Mouse,Lung,Sepsis,Lung Injury,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,Oxygen,Oxygen,China

We found that hydrogen enhances proliferation of four out of seven human cancer cell lines (the responders). The proliferation-promoting effects were not correlated with basal levels of cellular reactive oxygen species. Expression profiling of the seven cells showed that the responders have higher gene expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) molecules than the non-responders. In addition, the responders have higher mitochondrial mass, higher mitochondrial superoxide, higher mitochondrial membrane potential, and higher mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity than the non-responders. In the responders, hydrogen provoked mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR).

To date, the potential benefits of HW against the deleterious effects of excessive salt intake and hypertension have not been investigated. Here, we first examined the effects of HW or HW supplemented with 0.1% ascorbic acid (HWA) on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) that had been fed a normal diet. In comparison to control rats given distilled water (DW), we found that HW did not significantly influence systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in SHR; however, the increase in SBP and DBP were inhibited in the HWA group. Next, four groups of SHR were given DW, 0.1% ascorbic acid-added DW (DWA), HW, or HWA in combination with a 4% NaCl-added diet. SHR fed the 4% NaCl-added diet showed increased hypertension; HWA treatment resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure. The HWA group tended to have lower plasma angiotensin II levels than the DW group. In addition, urinary volumes and urinary sodium levels were significantly lower in the HWA group than the DW group. Urinary isoprostane, an oxidative stress marker, was also significantly lower in the HWA group, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of HWA on blood pressure elevation was caused by a reduction in oxidative stress. These findings suggest a synergistic interaction between HW and ascorbic acid, and also suggest that HWA ingestion has potential for prevention of hypertension.

However, hydrogen is slightly soluble in water, which leads to poor effect of oral hydrogen-rich water therapy. In this study, the nano-bubble hydrogen water (nano-HW) (about 0.7 ​ppm) was prepared and its therapeutic effect against viral infection was investigated by utilizing spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV)-infected zebrafish as model. Three-month-old zebrafish were divided into nano-HW treatment-treated group and aquaculture water treated group (control group). The results revealed that the cumulative mortality rate of SVCV-infected zebrafish was reduced by 40% after treatment with nano-bubble hydrogen water, and qRT-PCR results showed that SVCV replication was significantly inhibited. Histopathological examination staining showed that SVCV infection caused tissue damage was greatly alleviated after treatment with nano-bubble hydrogen water. Futhermore, SVCV infection caused reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was significantly reduced upon nano-HW treatment. The level of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α was remarkably reduced in the nano-HW-treated group in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our data demonstrated for the first time that nano-HW could inhibit the inflammatory response caused by viral infection in zebrafish, which suggests that nano-HW can be applied to antiviral research，and provides a novel therapeutic strategy for virus-caused inflammation related disease.

H2 acts as an antioxidant and has been clinically and experimentally proven to ameliorate inflammation. This study was performed to investigate whether H2 could inhibit NET formation and excessive neutrophil activation. Neutrophils isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers were stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or the calcium ionophore A23187 in H2-exposed or control media. Compared with control neutrophils, PMA- or A23187-stimulated human neutrophils exposed to H2 exhibited reduced neutrophil aggregation, citrullination of histones, membrane disruption by chromatin complexes, and release of NET components. CXCR4high neutrophils are highly prone to NETs, and H2 suppressed Ser-139 phosphorylation in H2AX, a marker of DNA damage, thereby suppressing the induction of CXCR4 expression. H2 suppressed both myeloperoxidase chlorination activity and production of reactive oxygen species to the same degree as N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid, while showing a more potent ability to inhibit NET formation than these antioxidants do in PMA-stimulated neutrophils. Although A23187 formed NETs in a reactive oxygen species–independent manner, H2 inhibited A23187-induced NET formation, probably via direct inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase 4-mediated histone citrullination. Inhalation of H2 inhibited the formation and release of NET components in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in animal models of lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis (mice and aged mini pigs).

Methods: One hundred and sixty ICR mice were divided into sham injury, hydrogen, pure burn, and burn+ hydrogen groups according to the random number table, with 40 mice in each group. Mice in pure burn group and burn+ hydrogen group were inflicted with 40% total body surface area full-thickness scald (hereafter referred to as burn) on the back, while mice in sham injury group and hydrogen group were sham injured. Mice in hydrogen group and burn+ hydrogen group inhaled 2% hydrogen for 1 h at post injury hour (PIH) 1 and 6, respectively, while mice in sham injury group and pure burn group inhaled air for 1 h. At PIH 24, lung tissue of six mice in each group was harvested, and then pathological changes of lung tissue were observed by HE staining and the lung tissue injury pathological score was calculated. Inferior vena cava blood and lung tissue of other eight mice in each group were obtained, and then content of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in serum and lung tissue was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results: LPS treatment reduced the expression levels of occludin and VE-cadherin in PMVECs, while hydrogen-rich medium can recover these changes. Furthermore, H2 can significantly ameliorate the excessive expression of ROCK and RhoA under sepsis-mimicking condition. The application of RhoA activator U-46619 resulted in a more significant elevation in cell apoptotic rate as well as reduction in the expression of junctional proteins.

Hydrogen also reduced ROS levels in the retina as assessed by DHE staining. Moreover, this result was consistent with the downregulation of expression of the oxidative stress hallmark OGG1. These findings suggested that hydrogen can reduce retinal oxidative stress induced by NaIO3, and this result was further verified using the antioxidant ALCAR. Mechanistic analysis revealed that hydrogen significantly inhibited the downregulation of Sirt3 expression, and this notion was confirmed using AICAR, which restores Sirt3 expression and activity. Moreover, hydrogen reduced the expression of p53, p21 and p16 and the number of blue-green precipitations in the retinas of NaIO3 mice as assessed by SA-β-gal staining. We also found that hydrogen decreased the expression of the DNA damage-related protein ATM, cyclinD1 and NF-κB but increased the expression of the DNA repair-related protein HMGB1, suggesting that hydrogen inhibits senescence in retinas of NaIO3 mice. Additionally, OCT examination revealed that hydrogen suppressed retinal high reflex formation significantly and prevented the retina from thinning.

Gut bacteria produce hydrogen (H2), which scavenges the hydroxyl radical (•OH). Because H2 diffuses within the cell, it is hypothesized that H2 scavenges cytoplasmic •OH (cyto •OH) and suppresses cellular senescence. However, the mechanisms of cyto •OH-induced cellular senescence and the physiological role of gut bacteria-secreted H2 have not been elucidated. Based on the pyocyanin-stimulated cyto •OH-induced cellular senescence model, the mechanism by which cyto •OH causes cellular senescence was investigated by adding a supersaturated concentration of H2 into the cell culture medium. Cyto •OH-generated lipid peroxide caused glutathione (GSH) and heme shortage, increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and induced cellular senescence via the phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase serine 1981 (p-ATMser1981)/p53 serine 15 (p-p53ser15)/p21 and phosphorylation of heme-regulated inhibitor (p-HRI)/phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha serine 51 (p-eIF2α)/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)/p16 pathways. Further, H2 suppressed increased H2O2 by suppressing cyto •OH-mediated lipid peroxide formation and cellular senescence induction via two pathways. H2 produced by gut bacteria diffuses throughout the body to scavenge cyto •OH in cells. Therefore, it is highly likely that gut bacteria-produced H2 is involved in intracellular maintenance of the redox state, thereby suppressing cellular senescence and individual aging.

Our group has already reported that hydrogen gas (H2) exerts a protective effect against sepsis in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying H2 treatment are not fully understood. This study investigated the effects of H2 on lung injuries in septic mice through the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic analysis. Male ICR mice used in this study were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation. And 2% H2 was inhaled for 1 h beginning at 1 and 6 h after sham or CLP operation. The iTRAQ-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was preformed to investigate lung proteomics. Sepsis-challenged animals had decreased survival rate, as well as had increased bacterial burden in blood, peritoneal lavage, and lung sample, which were significantly ameliorated by H2 treatment. Moreover, a total of 4,472 proteins were quantified, and 192 differentially expressed proteins were related to the protective mechanism of H2 against sepsis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that H2-related differential proteins could be related to muscle contraction, oxygen transport, protein synthesis, collagen barrier membranes, cell adhesion, and coagulation function. These proteins were significantly enriched in four signaling pathways, and two of which are associated with coagulation. In addition, H2 alleviates ALI in septic mice through downregulating the expression of Sema 7A, OTULIN, and MAP3K1 as well as upregulating the expression of Transferrin. Thus, our findings provide an insight into the mechanism of H2 treatment in sepsis by proteomic approach, which may be helpful to the clinic application of H2 in patients with sepsis.

However, molecular data to support therapeutic functions attributed to the biological activities of H2 remain elusive. Here, using transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches coupled with biochemistry and micro-CT technics, we evaluated the effect of long-term (6 months) and daily use of H2 on liver function. Rats exposed 2 h daily to H2 either by drinking HRW (H2 dissolved in H2O) or by breathing 4% H2 gas showed reduced lipogenesis and enhanced lipolysis in the liver, which was associated with apparent loss of visceral fat and brown adipose tissue together with a reduced level of serum lipids. Both transcripts and metabolites enriched in H2-treated rats revealed alteration of amino acid metabolism pathways and activation of purine nucleotides and carbohydrate biosynthesis pathways. Analysis of the interaction network of genes and metabolites and correlation tests revealed that NADP is the central regulator of H2 induced metabolic alterations in the liver, which was further confirmed by an increase in the level of components of metabolic pathways that require NADP as substrate. Evidence of immune response regulation activity was also observed in response to exposure to H2.

Additionally, hydrogen inhalation ameliorated the levothyroxine-induced metabolic increase and cardiac hypertrophy in rats. Serum brain natriuretic peptide expression was also attenuated by hydrogen treatment. However, hydrogen had no significant effect on levothyroxine -induced serum troponin I and serum thyroid hormone changes. Hydrogen treatment also reduced the levothyroxine-induced increase in cardiac malondialdehyde, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and serum hydrogen peroxide levels and upregulated superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity.

The molecular mechanism of hydrogen (H2) administration, as a promising strategy for the treatment of SAE, is still unclear. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is essential for alleviating symptoms and complications of SAE. However, little is known about the role of PPARα in SAE. This study was designed to evaluate the expression of PPARα in SAE and determine whether H2 can alleviate SAE through regulation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway and its downstream proteins via PPARα. After the injection of GW6471 (the PPARα inhibitor) or GW7647 (the PPARα agonist) or saline, C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation, then treated with 2% H2 by inhalation for 1 h after the operation. The 7-day survival rate was recorded, and the Y-maze test was used to assess cognitive function. Apoptotic cells were observed by TUNEL staining, and brain tissues were collected for pathological analysis by H&E staining. In addition, the levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-18, HMGB1, and IL-1β) were measured by ELISA and the expression of PPARα, CREB, BDNF and other neurotrophins, postsynaptic density protein of 95 kDa (PSD95) by Western blot. The relationship between PPARα and the CREB-BDNF signaling pathway was explored by coimmunoprecipitation (CO-IP). The results showed the expression of PPARα was decreased in SAE mice and that activation of PPARα in septic mice improved the survival rate and alleviated cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, PPARα may have exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in septic mice. In addition, the GW6471 downregulated the expression of CREB, BDNF and other neurotrophins in SAE mice treated with H2. The expression of PSD95 was also downregulated and upregulated following the expression of PPARα. These results illustrated that H2 alleviates sepsis-induced brain injury in mice through the regulation of neurotrophins and hippocampal plasticity-related genes via PPARα by activating the CREB-BDNF signaling pathway.

Excessive oxidative stress is a key factor delaying wound healing. Hydrogen is an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic medical gas with safety, effectiveness, and penetrability. However, the effects of local treatment of hydrogen on wound healing and its potential mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, Kunming (KM) mice were used to set up a wound model. All the mice were randomly divided into the control, the local treatment with saline group, the local treatment with the hydrogen-rich saline group, and the intraperitoneal injection of the hydrogen-rich saline group. To evaluate the impact of hydrogen-rich saline on wound healing, we assessed the wound healing rate, wound closure time, histomorphology, oxidative stress indicators, inflammatory cytokines, the apoptosis index, and the expression of the nuclear factor-erythroid-related factor 2(Nrf-2). Furthermore, the immortalized nontumorigenic human epidermal (HaCaT) cells were chosen to investigate the therapeutic effects of hydrogen-rich medium on oxidative stress and its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that local treatment of hydrogen-rich saline shortened wound closure time and reduced the level of proinflammatory cytokines and lipid peroxidation. Meanwhile, it decreased the cell apoptosis index and increased the Nrf-2 expression. Besides, hydrogen-rich medium relieved the oxidative stress via the activation of the Nrf-2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway. In conclusion, local treatment of hydrogen-rich saline exhibits the healing-promoting function through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. Hydrogen relieves the oxidative stress in the wound microenvironment via Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathway.

Hydrogen therapy has been proven effective in the treatment of myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a serious cardiovascular complication of long-term chronic diabetes that is linked to increased heart failure and arrhythmia morbidity. The effect of hydrogen on the pathogenesis of DCM is yet to be determined. Metformin is a well-known pharmacological agent for the treatment of diabetes; however, the application of large doses of the drug is limited by its side effects. Therefore, this highlights the importance of developing novel therapies against DCM. In this regard, we investigated the effect of hydrogen on DCM and the mechanisms that underlie it. Furthermore, we also assessed the efficacy of co-administration of metformin and hydrogen. In this study, we found that hydrogen improved cardiac dysfunction and abnormal morphological structure in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. As a mechanism, it was confirmed that hydrogen mediated its action by reducing pyroptosis via inhibition of the AMPK/mTOR/NLRP3 signaling pathway and ameliorating fibrosis via inhibition of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. Furthermore, our findings suggested that co-administration of hydrogen and metformin shows potent protective effects, as evidenced by increased survival rates, reduced fasting blood glucose, and decreased cell injury when compared to a single application of metformin. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that hydrogen inhalation attenuates DCM by reducing pyroptosis and fibrosis and that hydrogen can be combined with metformin to exhibit a more potent cardioprotective effect in DCM.

Although renal IRI has been induced in pig models in many ways, simultaneous bilateral ischemia or unilateral ischemia along with contralateral nephrectomy models only provide data on the renal response to a single ischemia time. Moreover, it has been reported that prolonged renal ischemia time in pigs for 120 min or more can cause irreversible renal damage and increase animal mortality. Methods: We developed a model that induces prolonged ischemia time and subsequent reperfusion injury without threatening the lives of pigs by subjecting the left and right kidneys to ischemia for 120 and 60 min, respectively. Using this novel model, we investigated whether hydrogen gas inhalation could alleviate renal IRI. Results: All animals (n=4) survived until the end of the observation period of 3 months in this model. Evaluation of the left and right kidneys immediately before and after IRI could be performed separately by blood sampling from each renal vein and renal biopsy during surgery, although the results of peripheral blood sampling during the follow-up were the mixed results of bilateral kidneys. The release of degraded DNA from the kidneys immediately after IRI and subsequent renal fibrosis at 3 months increased in response to ischemia time. Although the effect of hydrogen gas on pathological findings was not obvious, the release of degraded DNA from the kidney, an acute marker of IRI, appeared to be suppressed. Conclusions: We have developed a novel model in which IRI of different ischemia times is induced in the bilateral kidney that provides two-fold information and allows for safe long-term observation experiments in pigs. Using this model, hydrogen gas inhalation appeared to reduce acute renal IRI, although the effect was not statistically significant.

Therefore, we explored the effect of short-term supplementation of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on the work performance and fatigue recovery of dragon boat athletes after training. (2) Methods: Eighteen dragon boat athletes who trained for 4 h a day (2 h in the morning and 2 h in the afternoon) were divided into an HRW group (n = 9) and a placebo water (PW) group (n = 9), drinking HRW or PW for 7 days.

Given the antioxidative effect of molecular hydrogen, some recent studies suggest the potential use of molecular hydrogen as a biomedicine for the treatment of ARDS. In this study, we aimed to explore the protective effects of magnesium hydride (MgH2) on two types of ARDS models and its underlying mechanism in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS model of the A549 cell line. The results showed that LPS successfully induced oxidative stress, inflammatory reaction, apoptosis, and barrier breakdown in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). MgH2 can exert an anti-inflammatory effect by down-regulating the expressions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). In addition, MgH2 decreased oxidative stress by eliminating intracellular ROS, inhibited apoptosis by regulating the expressions of cytochrome c, Bax, and Bcl-2, and suppressed barrier breakdown by up-regulating the expression of ZO-1 and occludin. Mechanistically, the expressions of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-P65, NLRP3, and cleaved-caspase-1 were decreased after MgH2 treatment, indicating that AKT/mTOR and NF-κB/NLRP3/IL-1β pathways participated in the protective effects of MgH2.

Therefore, we sought to assess the potential effect of H2 on colorectal cancer (CRC) in this study. Methods: The effect of H2 on the proliferation and apoptosis of RKO, SW480, and HCT116 CRC cell lines was assayed by CCK-8, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays. The effect of H2 on tumor growth was observed in xenograft implantation models (inhalation of 67% hydrogen two hours per day). Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed to examine the expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, AKT, pAKT, and SCD1 in CRC cell lines and xenograft mouse models. The expression of SCD1 in 491 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded CRC specimens was investigated with immunochemistry. The relationship between SCD1 status and clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes was determined. Results: Hydrogen treatment suppressed the proliferation of CRC cell lines independent of apoptosis, and the cell lines showed different responses to different doses of H2. Hydrogen also elicited a potent antitumor effect to reduce CRC tumor volume and weight in vivo. Western blot and IHC staining demonstrated that H2 inhibits CRC cell proliferation by decreasing pAKT/SCD1 levels, and the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by H2 was reversed by the AKT activator SC79. IHC showed that SCD1 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues than in normal epithelial tissues (70.3% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.02) and was correlated with a more advanced TNM stage (III vs. I + II; 75.9% vs. 66.3%, p = 0.02), lymph node metastasis (with vs. without; 75.9% vs. 66.3%, p = 0.02), and patients without a family history of CRC (78.7% vs. 62.1%, p = 0.047).

HRW intake mainly induced significant increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Clostridium XI, and decrease in Bacteroides. HI mainly induced decreased abundances of Blautia and Paraprevotella. The metabolic function was determined by metabolic cage analysis and showed that HI decreased the voluntary intake and excretions of rats, while HRW intake did not.

Due to its ability to regulate cell homeostasis, H2 therapy has exhibited marked therapeutic effects on a number of oxidative stress-associated diseases. The present study investigated the effectiveness of H2 therapy in protecting against myocardial injury in a rat model of asphyxial cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Rats underwent 10-min asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and were randomly divided into control and H2 therapy groups. After resuscitation, the H2 therapy group was administered room air mixed with 2% H2 gas for respiration. During CA/CPR, the arterial pressure and heart rate were measured every minute. Survival rate, cardiac function, myocardial injury biomarkers creatine kinase-MB and cardiac troponin-T, and histopathological changes were evaluated to determine the protective effects of H2 therapy in CA/CPR. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were used to determine the expression levels of autophagy-associated proteins. In vitro, H9C2 cells were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation and H2-rich medium was used in H2 treatment groups. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to observe the expression levels of autophagy-associated proteins. Moreover, an adenovirus-monomeric red fluorescent protein-green fluorescent protein-LC3 construct was used to explore the dynamics of autophagy in the H9C2 cells. The results showed that H2 therapy significantly improved post-resuscitation survival and cardiac function. H2 therapy also improved mitochondrial mass and decreased autophagosome numbers in cardiomyocytes after resuscitation. The treatment inhibited autophagy activation, with lower expression levels of autophagy-associated proteins and decreased autophagosome formation in vivo and vitro. In conclusion, H2 gas inhalation after return of spontaneous circulation improved cardiac function via the inhibition of autophagy.

However, the continuous generation of H2 molecules within the tumor is challenging. Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys have been extensively used in the clinic as implantable metals. Here we develop, by decorating platinum on the surface of Mg rods, a Mg-based galvanic cell (MgG), which allows the continuous generation of H2 in an aqueous environment due to galvanic-cell-accelerated water etching of Mg. By implanting MgG rods into a tumor, H2 molecules can be generated within the tumor, which induces mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular redox homeostasis destruction.

Methods: The eustachian tube dysfunction score, pure tone air conduction threshold, bone conduction threshold, the score of tympanogram and otoscope were prospectively observed in patients with deafness after radiotherapy only or combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Paired t test and one-way analysis of variance were used to analyze the data before and after treatment. Results: A total of 17 patients were observed. The median time from radiotherapy to now was 228 months, and the median time from the diagnose of deafness to now was 92 months. After 4 weeks of hydrogen inhalation, the score of eustachian tube dysfunction, air conduction and bone conduction hearing thresholds were significantly reduced, P values were 0.0293, 0.0027, 0.0404, respectively. The mean air-bone gap, the score of otoendoscopy and tympanogram were also decreased, but the differences were not significant (P = 0.2079, P = 0.0536, P = 0.1056). Patients with radiotherapy alone and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy had significantly lower air conduction hearing threshold after hydrogen absorption (P = 0.0142, P = 0.0495). The results of air and bone hearing thresholds before, 4 and 12 weeks after hydrogen inhalation showed a descending trend. The air and bone hearing thresholds before hydrogen inhalation were 74.69 ± 27.03 dB and 45.70 ± 21.58 dB, respectively. At the 12th week, the mean values of air and bone hearing thresholds were the lowest, which were 66.88 ± 20.88 dB and 40.94 ± 18.93 dB, respectively, but there was no significant difference in air and bone hearing thresholds among all groups (P = 0.6755, P = 0.7712).

However, the effect of hydrogen-rich gas mixture (HG) inhalation on physiological responses has been poorly investigated. We examined the impact of acute HG inhalation on subsequent oxidative stress, muscle damage, and exercise performances during the recovery period after a strenuous exercise. This is a two-trial, double-blind, crossover, repeated measures study. Eight physically active male volunteers inhaled HG (estimated fraction of inspired oxygen and hydrogen were 21.57 and 4.08% at most, respectively) or normal gas (placebo, ambient air 400 m above sea level) during a 60-minute recovery phase after oxidative stress-inducing exercise) completion comprising 30-minute treadmill running at an intensity corresponding to 75% of maximal oxygen uptake and squat jumps (5 sets × 10 repetitions). Before oxidative stress-inducing exercise and 10 minutes after the post-exercise gas inhalation, blood and urine samples were obtained and exercise performances (jumping ability; pedaling power output; muscle strength) were evaluated. Post-exercise HG inhalation attenuated the increase in urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine excretion rate (P < 0.05), a DNA oxidation marker, and the reduction in the countermovement jump height (P < 0.05), compared with Placebo inhalation. Other exercise performances and blood oxidative stress and muscle damage markers did not differ between HG and Placebo inhalation. Moreover, the increase in urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine excretion rate was significantly associated with countermovement jump performance reduction (r = –0.78, P < 0.01). These findings suggested that HG inhalation during post-exercise recovery period might improve exercise performance via reducing systemic oxidative damage.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can impair endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) functions, including proliferation, migration, and tube formation. EPCs can migrate to the damaged area, differentiate into ECs, and participate in vascular repair, which improves pulmonary capillary endothelial dysfunction and maintains the integrity of the endothelial barrier. Hydrogen (H2) contributes to the repairment of lung injury and the damage of ECs. We therefore speculate that H2 protects the EPCs against LPS-induced damage, and it's mechanism will be explored. The bone marrow-derived EPCs from ICR Mice were treated with LPS to establish a damaged model. Then EPCs were incubated with H2, and treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor L-NAME. MTT assay, transwell assay and tube formation assay were used to detect the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of EPCs. The expression levels of target proteins were detected by Western blot. Results found that H2 repaired EPCs proliferation, migration and tube formation functions damaged by LPS. LY294002 and L-NAME significantly inhibited the repaired effect of H2 on LPS-induced dysfunctions of EPCs. H2 also restored levels of phosphor-AKT (p-AKT), eNOS and phosphor-eNOS (p-eNOS) suppressed by LPS.

This study was designed to demonstrate that whether the benefit effects of hydrogen can maintain the dynamic process of mitochondrial fusion/fission to mitigate human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) injury exposed to endotoxin through HO-1. Methods: HUVECs cells cultured with medium which contained Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), Saline, hydrogen, Mdivi-1 (a dynamin-related protein 1 [Drp1] inhibitor) or zinc protoporphyrin IX (Znpp) (a HO-1 inhibitor) were also used in the research. Cell death and apoptosis were assessed using FITC annexin V and PI. Mitochondria were stained with Mitotracker orange and observed by confocal microscope. Oxygen consumption rate was assessed by seahorse xf24 extracellular analyzer. Mitochondrial membrane potential monitored by JC-1 dye. The expressions of Drp1 and HO-1 were tested by Western blot. The co-localization of Drp1 and mitochondria was determined by immunofluorescence. Results: LPS caused a decrease in ATP content, mitochondrial membrane potential, and maximal respiration rate. At the same time, increased expression of Drp1 were observed in LPS-stimulated HUVECs, concomitantly with excessive mitochondrial fission. We found that hydrogen-rich medium can increase ATP content, mitochondrial membrane potential and maximal respiration rate, and decrease the expression of Drp1 in LPS-treated HUVECs. Meanwhile, hydrogen can ameliorate excessive mitochondrial fission caused by LPS. Furthermore, hydrogen-rich medium had a similar effect to Mdivi-1, a mitochondrial fission blocker. Both of them rescued the up-regulation of Drp1 and mitochondrial fission induced by LPS, then normalized mitochondrial shape after LPS stimulation.

Diabetic stroke is associated with a higher risk of death and worse neural function. The identification of effective anti-inflammatory molecules with translational advantages is particularly important to promote perioperative neurorestorative effects. Applying molecular hydrogen, we measured blood glucose levels before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), 48-h cerebral oedema and infarct volumes, as well as 28-day weight, survival and neurological function. We also measured the levels of TLR4, NF-κB p65, phosphorylated NF-κB p65, catecholamines, acetylcholine and inflammatory factors. All measurements comprehensively showed the positive effect and translational advantage of molecular hydrogen on diabetic stroke. Molecular hydrogen improved the weight, survival and long-term neurological function of rats with diabetic stroke and alleviated changes in blood glucose levels before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), but no difference in circadian rhythm was observed. Molecular hydrogen inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-κB and significantly reduced inflammation. Molecular hydrogen mediates neurorestorative effects after stroke in diabetic rats. The effect is independent of circadian rhythms, indicating translational advantages. The molecular mechanism is related to the TLR4/NF-κB pathway and inflammation.

Molecular hydrogen was recently discovered as a new effective antioxidant that can restore lung function after COVID-19. The effect of molecular hydrogen on lung function was studied by comparing EBC protein profiles before and after hydrogen therapy in volunteers who had recovered from COVID-19. Total 108 EBC samples were collected with RTube devices from recovered volunteers before and after hydrogen inhalation. The collecting tube was additionally rinsed with methanol. Peptides obtained after tryptic digestion were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a nano-LC Dionex system coupled to tims TOF Pro (Bruker) tandem high-resolution mass-spectrometer located in Skoltech. Totally 478 proteins and 1350 peptides were revealed. It was shown that in EBC of the group after the hydrogen therapy, the concentration of structural and protective proteins increased significantly, as well as the average number of detected proteins increased by 15% (from 349 to 398), and the intensity of the 36 most common proteins increased ~3 times compared with the group, which did not receive the therapy. Dermcidin, an antibiotic and proteolytic protein, was found one of the most often found proteins in the group after therapy.

As a result of their selective reactive oxygen radical removal, hydrogen molecules are strong candidates, but their application is limited by the small hydrogen supply and short duration of action. In this study, we for the first time combined nanobubble (NB) technology and hydrogen water to remove reactive oxygen species (ROS) using copper ions as a representative environmental pollutant and Tetrahymena thermophila as a model organism. Hydrogen NBs displayed a remarkable capability of removing H2O2 and O2•- at molar ratios of 8:1 and 240:1, respectively, which were unable to be removed by dissolved hydrogen molecules only. During the oxidative defense phase, hydrogen NB water either directly removed ROS or increased the activity and relative expression of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). During the oxidative inhibition phase, hydrogen NB water exerted antioxidant effects mainly by increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase and GSH-Px as well as the expression of the corresponding genes. Our results provide an important theoretical support for the wide application of hydrogen NBs in empowering the antioxidant defense system.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the prophylactic effects of hydrogen-rich water instillation in a rat corneal alkali burn model. Hydrogen-rich water (hydrogen group) or physiological saline (vehicle group) was instilled continuously to the normal rat cornea for 5 min. At 6 h after instillation, the cornea was exposed to alkali. The area of corneal epithelial defect (CED) was measured every 6 h until 24 h after alkali exposure. In addition, at 6 and 24 h after injury, histological and immunohistochemical observations were made and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to investigate superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD)1, SOD2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) mRNA expression. CED at 12 h and the number of inflammatory infiltrating cells at 6 h after injury were significantly smaller in the hydrogen group than the vehicle group. Furthermore, SOD1 expression was significantly higher in the hydrogen group than the vehicle group at both 6 and 24 h, and the number of PGC-1α-positive cells was significantly larger in the hydrogen group than the vehicle group at 6 h after injury. In this model, prophylactic instillation of hydrogen-rich water suppressed alkali burn-induced inflammation, likely by upregulating expression of antioxidants such as SOD1 and PGC-1α.

Methods and results: In this study, ADSCs acted as an in vitro myogenic differentiating mode. First, the Alamar blue Staining and mitochondrial tracer technique were used to verify whether hydrogen combined with 5-Aza could promote cell proliferation. In addition, this study assessed myogenic differentiating markers (e.g., Myogenin, Mhc and Myod protein expressions) based on the Western blotting assay, analysis on cellular morphological characteristics (e.g., Myotube number, length, diameter and maturation index), RT-PCR (Myod, Myogenin and Mhc mRNA expression) and Immunofluorescence analysis (Desmin, Myosin and β-actin protein expression). Finally, to verify the mechanism of myogenic differentiation of hydrogen-bound 5-Aza, we performed bioinformatics analysis and Western blot to detect the expression of p-P38 protein. Hydrogen combined with 5-Aza significantly enhanced the proliferation and myogenic differentiation of ADSCs in vitro by increasing the number of single-cell mitochondria and upregulating the expression of myogenic biomarkers such as Myod, Mhc and myotube formation. The expressions of p-P38 was up-regulated by hydrogen combined with 5-Aza. The differentiating ability was suppressed when the cells were cultivated in combination with SB203580 (p38 MAPK signal pathway inhibitor). Conclusions: Hydrogen alleviates the cytotoxicity of 5-Aza and synergistically promotes the myogenic differentiation capacity of adipose stem cells via the p38 MAPK pathway.

Ten healthy, trained subjects in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design received H2-rich calcium powder (HCP) (1500 mg, containing 2.544 μg of H2) or H2-depleted placebo (1500 mg) supplements 1 h pre-exercise. They performed six bouts of 7 s all-out pedaling (HIIT) at 7.5% of body weight separated by 40 s pedaling intervals, followed by a recovery period. Blood gases' pH, PCO2, and HCO3- concentrations were measured at rest. Muscle deoxygenation (deoxy[Hb + Mb]) and tissue O2 saturation (StO2) were determined via time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy in the vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles from rest to recovery. At rest, the HCP group had significantly higher PCO2 and HCO3- concentrations and a slight tendency toward acidosis. During exercise, the first HIIT bout's peak power was significantly higher in HCP (839 ± 112 W) vs. Placebo (816 ± 108 W, p = 0.001), and HCP had a notable effect on significantly increased deoxy[Hb + Mb] concentration during HIIT exercise, despite no differences in heart rate response. The HCP group showed significantly greater O2 extraction in VL and microvascular (Hb) volume in RF during HIIT exercise. The HIIT exercise provided significantly improved blood flow and muscle reoxygenation rates in both the RF and VL during passive recovery compared to rest in all groups. The HCP supplement might exert ergogenic effects on high-intensity exercise and prove advantageous for improving anaerobic HIIT exercise performance.

Numerous studies have shown that electromagnetic pulse (EMP) radiation may have seriously damaging effects on reproductive health, through nonthermal effects and oxidative stress. Molecular hydrogen, a selective hydroxyl radical scavenger, explains the protective effects against many diseases closely associated with oxidative damage, such as ionizing radiation (IR). We sought to characterize the beneficial effects of molecular hydrogen on the male reproductive system in a rodent EMP exposure model. The 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to EMP (peak intensity 1000 kV/m, pulse edge 20 ns, pulse width 200 ns, 1 Hz, and 200 pulses), with or without hydrogen-rich water. The pathological structure of the testis, the rate of apoptosis of the testis, the serum testosterone level, the sperm parameters, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes of the testis were measured. Then, transcriptomic and untargeted metabolomic analyses were applied to uncover the underlying mechanism. Exposure to EMP increased testicular apoptosis rate and apoptosis protein level, decreased sperm viability and motility, decreased serum testosterone levels, and diminished testicular antioxidant capacity. Molecular hydrogen-alleviated damage decreased the testicular apoptosis rate and apoptosis protein level, increased sperm motility, increased serum testosterone levels, and improved antioxidative capacity. Omics results showed that molecular hydrogen has a strong influence on metabolic pathways, and EMP affects mainly oxidative phosphorylation, TNF signaling pathways, and cytokine-receptor interactions. The mechanism of molecular hydrogen's effect may be related to the reversal of some metabolite levels.

However, there is still no concern on the beneficial effects of hydrogen in DPN. This paper aimed to evaluate the effects of exogenous hydrogen to reduce the severity of DPN in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Compared with hydrogen-rich saline treatment, hydrogen inhalation significantly reduced blood glucose levels in diabetic rats in the 4th and 8th weeks. With regard to nerve function, hydrogen administration significantly attenuated the decrease in the velocity of motor nerve conduction in diabetic animals. In addition, hydrogen significantly attenuated oxidative stress by reducing the level of malondialdehyde, reactive oxygen species, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and meaningfully enhanced the antioxidant capability by partially restoring the activities of superoxide dismutase.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the remarkable effect of a small amount of H2 remain elusive. No knowledge has been available on the role of H2 in the etiology of pregnancy disorders or its direct influence on human immune cells. Since maternal immunity, T cells in particular, plays a critical role in pregnancy maintenance. We investigated the effects of H2 on T cells and its relation to preterm birth (PTB). Main methods: Exhaled H2 concentrations in pregnant women were measured and correlated with cytokine concentrations in maternal and umbilical cord blood. H2 was added to T cells collected from healthy donors, and differentiation and proliferation were examined. Energy metabolism was also examined. H2 was administered to mice and cytokine expression was compared. Key findings: Our prospective observational study revealed that maternal production of H2 is significantly lower in pregnant women with PTB, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting PTB. We found that H2 has clear associations with several maternal cytokines, and acts as an immunomodulator by exerting mitochondrial function in human T cells. Moreover, in vivo administration of H2 to pregnant mice regulated inflammatory responses and reduced PTB caused by T cell activation, which further supports the notion that H2 may contribute to prolonged gestation through its immunomodulatory effect. Significance: Measuring maternal H2-production could be a potential clinical tool in the management of PTB, and H2 may have positive impact on pregnancy maintenance.",Positive,Mouse,Pregnancy,Immune Regulation,Immune Dysfunction,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,Japan

Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hydrogen (H2) on relieving drinking and hangover symptoms in 20 healthy volunteers. Methods: In this pilot, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, matched, crossover interventional trial, participants were matched into pairs and randomly assigned. Study group 1 inhaled placebo air for 1 hr, followed by drinking 100 ml of liquor (40% alcohol) within 10 min, and then pure water. Study group 2 inhaled a mixture of H2 and O2 gas for 1 hr, followed by drinking 100 ml of liquor within 10 min, and then H2 dissolved in water. On a second intervention day (crossover) ≥1 wk later, study-group subjects were switched to the opposite order. Breath alcohol concentration (BrAC), hangover severity, and cognitive scores were measured. Results: The BrACs within the H2 group were significantly lower than those within the placebo group after 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min (P < 0.05). The H2 group reported having fewer hangover symptoms compared with the placebo group (Placebo: 77% of symptoms absent, 19.7% of mild symptoms, 2.7% of moderate symptoms, 0.7% of severe symptoms; H2: 88.6% of symptoms absent, 10% of mild symptoms, 1.3% of moderate symptoms, 0% of severe symptoms; P < 0.001). H2 treatment improved cognitive testing scores (P < 0.05), including attention and executive functions. Furthermore, consumption of H2 was negatively (β = -13.016; 95% CI: -17.726, -8.305; P < 0.001) and female sex was positively (β = 22.611; 95% CI: 16.226, 28.997; P < 0.001) correlated with increased BrACs.

Clinical therapies for neuropathic pain are still unsatisfactory with notable side effects. Recent studies have reported the protective role of molecular hydrogen (H2) in different diseases including neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's as well as its antidepressant activities in animals with chronic stress. This study explored the effects of treatment with hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in male mice with neuropathic pain induced by the chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve (CCI) and the accompanying affective deficits. The likely pathways implied in the HRW analgesic activity, as well as the interaction between heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) enzyme and H2 during neuropathic pain were also studied. The results showed: (i) the inhibitory effects of the repetitive treatment with HRW on the allodynia and hyperalgesia provoked by CCI; (ii) the anxiolytic and antidepressant actions of HRW in animals with neuropathic pain; (iii) the contribution of the antioxidant enzymes (HO-1 and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1) and the ATP sensitive potassium channels in the painkiller activities of HRW during neuropathic pain; (iv) a positive interaction between the HO-1 and H2 systems in inhibiting the CCI-induced neuropathy; and (v) the antioxidant, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and/or antiapoptotic features of HRW treatment in the dorsal root ganglia and/or amygdala of sciatic nerve-injured mice. This study demonstrates new protective actions of H2 and suggests that treatment with HRW might be an interesting therapeutic strategy for chronic neuropathic pain and its associated mood disorders.

The potential use of molecular hydrogen (H2) as a new therapy for neurological disorders has been demonstrated. Recent studies prove its analgesic properties in animals with neuropathic pain, but the possible antinociceptive, antidepressant, and/or anxiolytic actions of H2 during persistent inflammatory pain have not been investigated. Therefore, using male mice with chronic inflammatory pain incited by the subplantar injection of complete Freud's adjuvant (CFA), we assessed the actions of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) systemically administered on: (1) the nociceptive responses and affective disorders associated and (2) the oxidative (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; 4-HNE), inflammatory (phosphorylated-NF-kB inhibitor alpha; p-IKBα), and apoptotic (Bcl-2-like protein 4; BAX) changes provoked by CFA in the paws and amygdala. The role of the antioxidant system in the analgesia induced by HRW systemically and locally administered was also determined. Our results revealed that the intraperitoneal administration of HRW, besides reducing inflammatory pain, also inhibited the depressive- and anxiolytic-like behaviors associated and the over expression of 4-HNE, p-IKBα, and BAX in paws and amygdala. The contribution of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 pathway in the analgesic activities of HRW, systemically or locally administered, was also shown. These data revealed the analgesic, antidepressant, and anxiolytic actions of HRW. The protective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant qualities of this treatment during inflammatory pain were also demonstrated. Therefore, this study proposes the usage of HRW as a potential therapy for chronic inflammatory pain and linked comorbidities.

Cosmetic treatments can have a positive effect on improving skin condition by cleaning up skin eruptions, thus improving the well-being of affected people. Hydrogen purification is a treatment that uses alkaline water generated by a device, which reduces sebum from the surface of the epidermis. This is a novel treatment that has recently been introduced to beauty salons. On the other hand, cosmetic acids have been used for many years for treating people with acne vulgaris and give spectacular results in terms of improving the skin condition. In this study, skin condition was evaluated with a Derma Unit SSC 3 device. The Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) was used to check acne severity. Twenty-four women aged 19-21 years (M = 20.13, SD = 0.80) diagnosed with mild acne vulgaris and a high sebum level participated in the study. Group A underwent a hydrogen purification treatment using an H2jet manipulator, which ejected alkaline water from the manipulator under pressure. Group B underwent a hydrogen purification treatment with the use of a phytic, pyruvic, lactic and ferulic acids at 40% mixture (pH 1.4). A series of four treatments was performed at 14-day intervals in both groups. Skin parameters were measured before and 30 days after the series of treatment. Very good results were obtained in both groups. The skin eruptions in patients were reduced and we also observed lower amounts of sebum on the surface of the epidermis, and an improvement in skin hydration. However, in group B, the results were better than in group A. The study showed that the synergy of the treatments produced much better effects than those obtained by completing the hydrogen purification treatment alone.

Electrolyzed hydrogen water (EHW) has been shown to alleviate inflammation in several diseases, such as renal disease and polymyositis/dermatomyositis. To investigate whether and how daily EHW consumption alleviates abdominal pain, the most common symptom of IBD, we examined the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of EHW in an IBD rat model, wherein colonic inflammation was induced by colorectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). We found that EHW significantly alleviated TNBS-induced abdominal pain and tissue inflammation. Moreover, the production of proinflammatory cytokines in inflamed colon tissue was also decreased significantly. Meanwhile, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is intricately involved in intestinal inflammation, was significantly suppressed by EHW. Additionally, expression of S100A9, an inflammatory biomarker of IBD, was significantly suppressed by EHW. These results suggest that the EHW prevented the overproduction of ROS due to its powerful free-radical scavenging ability and blocked the crosstalk between oxidative stress and inflammation, thereby suppressing colonic inflammation and alleviating abdominal pain.

Previous studies demonstrated that hydrogen inhalation mitigates post-CA brain injury. However, factors affecting the efficacy of hydrogen remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the influence of oxygen concentration and targeted temperature on neuroprotective effect in a CA rat model of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Methods: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated after 7 min of untreated VF in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Immediately following successful resuscitation, animals were randomized to be ventilated with 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen (21%O2); 2% hydrogen, 21% oxygen, and 77% nitrogen (2%H2 + 21%O2); 2% hydrogen, 50% oxygen, and 48% nitrogen (2%H2 + 50%O2); or 2% hydrogen and 98% oxygen (2%H2 + 98%O2) for 3 h.

The following study investigated the protective role of hydrogen (H2), a gaseous molecule without known toxicity, in LPS-induced lung injury in mice and explored its potential molecular mechanisms. Methods: Mice were randomly divided into three groups: H2 control group, LPS group, and LPS + H2 group. The mice were euthanized at the indicated time points, and the specimens were collected. The 72 h survival rates, cytokines contents, pathological changes, expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and oxidative stress indicators were analyzed. Moreover, under different culture conditions, RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were used to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of H2 in vitro. Cells were divided into the following groups: PBS group, LPS group, and LPS + H2 group. The cell viability, intracellular ROS, cytokines, and expression of TLR4 and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) were observed. Results: Hydrogen inhalation increased the survival rate to 80%, reduced LPS-induced lung damage, and decreased inflammatory cytokine release in LPS mice. Besides, H2 showed remarked anti-oxidative activity to reduce the MDA and NO contents in the lung. In vitro data further indicated that H2 down-regulates the levels of ROS, NO, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in LPS-stimulated macrophages and inhibits the expression of TLR4 and the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB).

Therefore, nanocarriers have been investigated for safer and more efficient administration of hydrogen. Silicon particles are suggested for oral administration with the ability to undergo a redox reaction with water to produce H2in vivo. The purpose of this work was to investigate the hydrogen generating abilities of silicon particles synthesized by centrifugal chemical vapor deposition (cCVD). High hydrogen generation rates up to 1310 ml/g at physiological pH 7.4 (82% yield) were observed. An in vitro model of oral administration showed that pretreatment in artificial gastric juice did not affect hydrogen generation.

Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of hydrogen-rich water (HRW), in terms of oxidative stress, on intestinal mucosal damage as well as changes in the gut microbiome and the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) content in feces. Methods: Hydrogen-rich water was orally administered for 5 days to investigate the effectiveness of indomethacin-induced enteropathy in mice. Small intestinal damage and luminal reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated to investigate the ameliorating effects of hydrogen. Then, components of the gut microbiome were analyzed; fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed using the cecal contents obtained from mice drinking HRW. The cecal contents were analyzed for the SCFAs content. Finally, cells from the macrophage cell line RAW264 were co-cultured with the supernatants of cecal contents. Results: Hydrogen-rich water significantly ameliorated IND-induced enteropathy histologically and reduced the expression of IND-induced inflammatory cytokines. Microscopic evaluation revealed that luminal ROS was significantly reduced and that HRW did not change the gut microbiota; however, FMT from HRW-treated animals ameliorated IND-induced enteropathy. The SCFA content in the cecal contents of HRW-treated animals was significantly higher than that in control animals. The supernatant had significantly increased interleukin-10 expression in RAW264 cells in vitro. Conclusion: Hydrogen-rich water ameliorated NSAID-induced enteropathy, not only via direct antioxidant effects but also via anti-inflammatory effects by increasing luminal SCFAs. These results suggest that hydrogen may have therapeutic potential in small intestinal inflammatory diseases.

However, no study has examined the effectiveness of H2 in treating hearing loss in humans. Thus, we investigated whether H2 is effective for the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). Materials and methods: We conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial at six hospitals between June 2019 and March 2022. The study protocol and trial registration have been published in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT, No. jRCTs06119004). We randomly assigned patients with ISSNHL to receive either H2 (H2 group) or air as a placebo (control group) through inhalation combined with the administration of systemic glucocorticoids and prostaglandin E1. The primary outcome was the hearing threshold and changes in hearing threshold 3 months after therapy. In contrast, the secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with a good prognosis (complete recovery or marked improvement). Results: Sixty-five patients with ISSNHL (31 and 34 in the H2 and control groups, respectively) were included in this study. The hearing threshold 3 months after treatment was not significantly different between the groups; 39.0 decibels (dB) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28.7-49.3) and 49.5 dB (95% CI: 40.3-58.7) in the H2 and control groups, respectively. In contrast, the changes in hearing threshold 3 months after treatment was 32.7 dB (95% CI: 24.2-41.3) and 24.2 dB (95% CI: 18.1-30.3) in the H2 and control groups, respectively. Consequently, the changes in hearing threshold were significantly better in the H2 group than in the control group (P = 0.048). However, no adverse effects due to the inhalation of H2 gas have been reported. Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate the efficacy of H2 for the treatment of ISSNHL in humans.

A growing amount of evidence has indicated potential connections between gut microbiota and mental disorders induced by METH and associations with neural and metabolic pathways. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between fecal microbial alterations and neuropsychiatric diseases in METH addictions. Thus, mental disorders and gut microbial alterations were analyzed by self-rating depression (SDS) and anxiety (SAS) scales and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Our results showed that increased SDS and SAS indices and decreased alpha diversity indicated more serious mental disorders and lower bacterial diversity in METH users than in the age-matched healthy control group. The gut microbial composition in female METH users was also significantly altered, with reductions in hydrogen-producing bacteria, including Bacteroides and Roseburia. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is spontaneously produced by intestinal bacteria in the process of anaerobic metabolism, which is the main pathway for H2 production in vivo. Numerous studies have shown that hydrogen intervention can significantly improve neuropsychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that hydrogen intervention, including drinking and inhaling, significantly alleviated mental disorders induced by METH abuse, and the inhalation of hydrogen also altered gut microbiota profiles in the METH abusers. These results suggest that hydrogen intervention has potential therapeutic applicability in the treatment of mental disorders in METH abusers.

This study aims to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of hydrogen-oxygen (H2/O2) treatment in cigarette smoke solution (CSS)-induced COPD-like injury in a female BALB/c mouse model. Methods: Thirty mice were randomly assigned to three groups: Control (n=8), COPD (n=10), and COPD + H2/O2 (n=12). CSS was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection twice weekly for 6 weeks during the COPD induction phase. Simultaneously, the COPD + H2/O2 group started received 75 minutes of inhalation therapy (42% H2) delivered by the Oxy-Hydrogen Generator twice daily for 9 weeks. Mice body weights and survival were measured throughout the study period. Neutrophil elastase (NE) activity and lung histopathological changes were also evaluated. Results: The results showed a higher survival rate in the COPD + H2/O2 group compared to the COPD group (100% vs. 80%) during the induction phase. Slight decreases in body weight gains were observed in the COPD and COPD + H2/O2 groups during the first 15 days of the induction phase, but there was no significant difference in mean body weights among the three groups throughout the study period. NE activity was numerically lower in the COPD + H2/O2 group compared to the COPD group. The histopathological evaluation showed significant improvements in the H2/O2-treated mice with respect to mean linear intercept (MLI) and lesion (inflammation and emphysema) scores. Improvements in goblet cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway epithelium were not significant.

It is associated with higher mortality, low quality of life, and long-term neurological sequelae in suspected patients. At present there is no specific treatment for SAE rather than supportive therapy and judicious use of antibiotics, which are sometimes associated with adverse effects. Molecular hydrogen (H2) has been reported to play crucial role in regulating inflammatory responses, neuronal injury, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in adult models of SAE. Here we report the protective effect of hydrogen-rich saline in juvenile SAE rat model and its possible underling mechanism(s). Materials and methods: Rats were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 8 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally to induce sepsis and hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) administered 1 h following LPS induction at a dose of 5 ml/kg. Rats were divided into: sham, sham + HRS, LPS and LPS + HRS. At 48 h, rats were sacrificed and Nissl staining for neuronal injury, TUNEL assay for apoptotic cells detection, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA protocol for inflammatory cytokines determination, mitochondrial dysfunction parameters, electron microscopy and western blot analysis were studied to examine the effect of HRS in LPS-induced septic rats. Results: Rats treated with HRS improved neuronal injury, improvement in rats' survival rate. ELISA analysis showed decreased TNF-α and IL-1β and increased IL-10 expression levels in the HRS-treated group. Apoptotic cells were decreased after HRS administration in septic rats. The numbers of GFAP and IBA-1positive cells were attenuated in the HRS-treated group when compared to the LPS group. Subsequently, GFAP and IBA-1 immunoreactivity were decreased after HRS treatment. Mitochondrial membrane potential detected by JC-1 dye and ATP content were decreased in septic rats, which were improved after HRS treatment, while release of ROS was increased in the LPS group reverted by HRS treatment, ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction. Further analysis by transmission electron microscopy showed decreased number of mitochondria and synapses, and disrupted mitochondrial membrane ultrastructure in the LPS group, while HRS administration increased mitochondria and synapses number. Conclusion: These data demonstrated that HRS can improve survival rate, attenuate neuroinflammation, astrocyte and microglial activation, neuronal injury and mitochondrial dysfunction in juvenile SAE rat model, making it a potential therapeutic candidate in treating paediatric SAE.

The effects of alkaline pH on oral mucosa have not been systematically studied. To assess the systemic (organ) and local (oral mucosal) effects of alkalinity, drinking water supplemented with Ca(OH)2 or NaOH, with pH 11.2 or 12 was administered to rats (n = 36) for 52 weeks. Tissues were subjected to histopathological examination; oral mucosal biopsy samples were also subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses for pankeratin, CK19, CK5, CK4, PCNA, ICAM-1, CD44, CD68, S-100, HSP 60, HSP70, and HSP90. At completion of the study, animals in the study groups had lower body weights (up to 29% less) than controls despite equal food and water intake, suggesting a systemic response to the alkaline treatment. The lowest body weight was found in rats exposed to water with the highest pH value and starting the experiment when young (6 weeks). No histological changes attributable to alkaline exposure occurred in the oral mucosa or other tissues studied. Alkaline exposure did not affect cell proliferation in the oral epithelium, as shown by the equal expression of PCNA in groups. The up-regulation of HSP70 protein expression in the oral mucosa of rats exposed to alkaline water, especially Ca(OH)2 treated rats, may indicate a protective response. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) positivity was lost in 6/12 rats treated with Ca(OH)2 with pH 11.2, and loss of CD44 expression was seen in 3/6 rats in both study groups exposed to alkaline water with pH 12. The results suggest that the oral mucosa in rats is resistant to the effects of highly alkaline drinking water. However, high alkalinity may have some unknown systemic effects leading to growth retardation, the cause of which remains to be determined.

Clinical observations and scientific arguments suggest that a selective scavenging property of H2 cannot adequately explain the beneficial effects of hydrogen. However, there is no experiment challenging the original published data, which suggested that molecular hydrogen dissolved in solution reacts with hydroxyl radicals in cell-free systems. Here we report that a hydrogen-saturated solution (0.6 mM) did not significantly reduce hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton system using 1 mM H2O2. We replicated the same condition as Ohsawa’s study (i.e. 5 μM H2O2), and observed a decrease in •OH radicals in both the H2-rich and N2-rich solutions, which may be caused by a decreased dissolved oxygen concentration. Finally, we determined the effect of hydrogen on a high-valence iron enzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and found that hydrogen could directly increase HRP activity in a dose-dependent manner.

Recently, alkaline-reduced water (ARW) consumption has garnered increasing attention in the field of sports. ARW effectively inhibits the oxidative stress generated in cells during high-intensity exercises; however, whether it exerts similar effects during exhaustive exercises remains unknown.

The participants were divided into two groups, wherein they consumed either purified water (PW group) or ARW (ARW group). Blood samples were collected before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 15 min after drinking water. The serum levels of oxidative stress markers and fatigue markers were determined. The results showed that ROS (p < 0.01) and NO levels (p < 0.001) were significantly decreased after ARW intake, and the reduction was more pronounced than that in the PW group. Interestingly, the increase in GPx and MDA levels was mediated by ARW intake (both p < 0.05) after exercise. The levels of fatigue markers, such as lactate (p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.001), and phosphate (p < 0.001), were significantly reduced in both groups, with ARW intervention showing more decreased markers. The correlation analysis results showed that ARW may help maintain homeostatic conditions for ROS, antioxidant systems, and fatigue markers.

Moreover, long-term drinking of H2-water (water infused with H2) enhanced energy expenditure to improve obesity and diabetes in db/db mice accompanied by the increased expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) by an unknown mechanism. H2 was ingested by drinking of H2-water or by oral administration of an H2-producing material, MgH2. The comprehensive gene expression profile in the liver of db/db mice was analyzed by DNA microarray. The molecular mechanisms underlying the gene expression profile was investigated using cultured HepG2 cells. Moreover, the effects on lifespan of drinking H2-water were examined using wild-type mice that were fed a fatty diet. Pathway analyses based on comprehensive gene expression revealed the increased expression of various genes involved in fatty acid and steroid metabolism. As a transcription pathway, the PPARα signaling pathway was identified to upregulate their genes by ingesting H2. As an early event, the gene expression of PGC-1α was transiently increased, followed by increased expression of FGF21. The expression of PGC-1α might be regulated indirectly through sequential regulation by H2, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and Akt/FoxO1 signaling, as suggested in cultured cell experiments. In wild-type mice fed the fatty diet, H2-water improved the level of plasma triglycerides and extended their average of lifespan.

Antioxidant therapy is currently considered one of the most promising strategies for IVDD treatment, given the crucial role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in IVDD pathogenesis. Herein, a ROS-responsive magnesium-containing microsphere (Mg@PLPE MS) was constructed for the antioxidative treatment of IVDD. The Mg@PLPE MS has a core-shell structure comprising poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and ROS-responsive polymer poly(PBT-co-EGDM) as the shell and a magnesium microparticle as the core. The poly(PBT-co-EGDM) can be destroyed by H2O2 through the H2O2-triggered hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transition, subsequently promoting an Mg-water reaction to produce H2. Thus, Mg@PLPE MS provides a valuable platform for H2O2 elimination and controlled H2 release. The generated H2 scavenge for ROS by reacting with noxious •OH. Notably, the Mg@PLPE MS exerted significant antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in a disc degeneration rat model and alleviated extracellular matrix degradation and disc cells apoptosis, thereby underlining its efficacy in IVDD treatment. The Mg@PLPE MS also exhibited robust biocompatibility and negligible toxicity, presenting the promise for the antioxidative treatment of IVDD in vivo. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Antioxidant therapy is currently considered one of the most promising strategies for intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) treatment, given the crucial role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in IVDD pathogenesis. Here, ROS-responsive magnesium-containing microspheres (Mg@PLPE MSs) were constructed to alleviate IVDD through controlled release of hydrogen gas. The Mg@PLPE MSs can effectively scavenge overproduced ROS by simultaneously reacting with H2O2 and •OH, thus creating a suitable microenvironment for inhibition of ECM degradation. As a result, Mg@PLPE MSs treated IVDD rats exhibit minimal nucleus pulposus decrease, less extracellular matrix degradation, minimal radial fissure of fibrous rings, and higher disc height index. Therefore, the as-prepared Mg@PLPE MS may shed a new light on clinical treatment of IVDD.

Hydrogen gas has showed promising effects for ischemia-reperfusion injury by reducing reactive oxygen species in various animal and clinical studies. We examined intestinal tissue injury by ischemia and reperfusion under continuous initiation of 3% hydrogen gas. Aim: To clarify the treatment effects and target cells of hydrogen gas for mesenteric ischemia. Methods: Three rat groups underwent 60-min mesenteric artery occlusion (ischemia), 60-min reperfusion following 60-min occlusion (reperfusion), or ischemia-reperfusion with the same duration under continuous 3% hydrogen gas inhalation (hydrogen). The distal ileum was harvested. Immunofluorescence staining with caspase-3 and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled 5 (LGR5), a specific marker of intestinal stem cell, was conducted to evaluate the injury location and cell types protected by hydrogen. mRNA expressions of LGR5, olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4), hairy and enhancer of split 1, Jagged 2, and Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Tissue oxidative stress was analyzed with immunostaining for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Systemic oxidative stress was evaluated by plasma 8-OHdG. Results: Ischemia damaged the epithelial layer at the tip of the villi, whereas reperfusion induced extensive apoptosis of the cells at the crypt base, which were identified as intestinal stem cells with double immunofluorescence stain. Hydrogen mitigated such apoptosis at the crypt base, and the LGR5 expression of the tissues was higher in the hydrogen group than in the reperfusion group. OLFM4 was also relatively higher in the hydrogen group, whereas other measured RNAs were comparable between the groups. 8-OHdG concentration was high in the reperfusion group, which was reduced by hydrogen, particularly at the crypt base. Serum 8-OHdG concentrations were relatively higher in both reperfusion and hydrogen groups without significance.

Moreover, the high toxicity of the traditional chemotherapeutics inevitably causes undesirable side effects. Herein, taking the advantages of biosafe H2 and small-sized nanoparticles in diffusion within tumor ECM, we develop a matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP-2) responsive size-switchable nanoparticle (UAMSN@Gel-PEG) that is composed of ultrasmall amino-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (UAMSN) wrapped within a PEG-conjugated gelatin to deliver H2 to the deep part of tumors for effective gas therapy. Ammonia borane (AB) is chosen as the H2 prodrug that can be effectively loaded into UAMSN by hydrogen-bonding adsorption. Gelatin is used as the substrate of MMP-2 to trigger size change and block AB inside UAMSN during blood circulation. PEG is introduced to further increase the particle size and endow the nanoparticle with long blood circulation to achieve effective tumor accumulation via the EPR effect. After accumulation into the tumor site, MMP-2 promptly digests gelatin to expose UAMSN loading AB for deep tumor penetration. Upon stimulation by the acidic tumor microenvironment, AB decomposes into H2 for further intratumor diffusion to achieve effective hydrogen therapy. Consequently, such a simultaneous deep tumor penetration of nanocarriers and H2 results in an evident suppression on tumor growth in a 4T1 tumor-bearing model without any obvious toxicity on normal tissues. Our synthetic nanosystem provides a promising strategy for the development of nanomedicines with enhanced tumor permeability and good biosafety for efficient tumor treatment.

Therapeutic hydrogen gas (H2) with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, has a potential for OA alleviation, but the targeted delivery and sustained release of H2 are still challenging. Herein, we develop an injectable calcium boride nanosheets (CBN) loaded hydrogel platform (CBN@GelDA hydrogel) as a high-payload and sustainable H2 precursor for OA treatment. The CBN@GelDA hydrogel could maintain constant physiological pH conditions which further promotes more H2 release than the CBN alone and lasts more than one week. The biocompatibility of this hydrogel with macrophages and chondrocytes is effectively enhanced. The experiments show that the CBN@GelDA hydrogel holds the ROS scavenging ability, reducing the expression of related inflammatory cytokines, lessening M1 macrophages but stimulating M2 phenotype, and thereby decreasing chondrocyte apoptosis, which facilitates to breaking of the vicious circle of OA progression. Furthermore, a single-time injection of the CBN@GelDA hydrogel markedly reduces joint destruction in OA rats. From what has been discussed above, this injectable spontaneous H2-releasing hydrogel is promising for OA treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Oxidative stress and inflammation play the key role in the occurrence and development of osteoarthritis (OA). The system of a hydrogel loaded with H2 precursor calcium boride nanosheet (CBN), which is the first to use as an H2 precursor, integrates superior injectable and biocompatible of hydrogel and the selection of antioxidant properties of H2. This system can improve H2 release behavior and achieve a single injection into the articular cavity to alleviate the progression of OA in rats.

In this study, we investigated whether intraperitoneal administration of saline containing H2 inhibits neuronal cell death caused by cerebral ischemia and measured the concentration of H2 in the carotid artery and inferior vena cava (IVC). Gerbils were subjected to transient unilateral cerebral ischemia twice, and saline or H2-rich saline was administered intraperitoneally three or seven times every 12 hours. We evaluated the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex on day 3 and the number of viable neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex on day 7. In addition, a single dose of saline or H2-rich saline was administered intraperitoneally, and blood H2 levels in the carotid artery and IVC were measured.

Chemokine-driven neuroinflammation is required for central sensitization and chronic allodynia following fractures, but specific molecular modulations are elusive. This present study explored whether hydrogen-rich saline, as one potent anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical, could alleviate fracture-caused allodynia by suppressing chemokine CXCL1 expression and iron overload. Methods: A mouse model of tibial fracture with intramedullary pinning was employed for establishing chronic allodynia. Three applications of hydrogen-rich saline (1, 5 or 10 mL/kg) were administrated intraperitoneally on a daily basis from days 4 to 6 following fractures. Spinal CXCL1 and its receptor CXCR2 levels, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expression and iron concentration were examined. Recombinant CXCL1, a selective CXCR2 antagonist and an iron chelator were used for verification of mechanisms. Results: Repetitive injections of hydrogen-rich saline (5 and 10 mL/kg but not 1 mL/kg) prevent fracture-caused mechanical allodynia and cold allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. Single exposure to hydrogen-rich saline (10 mL/kg) on day 14 after orthopedic surgeries controls the established persistent fracture allodynia. Furthermore, hydrogen-rich saline therapy reduces spinal CXCL1/CXCR2 over-expression and TfR1-mediated iron accumulation in fracture mice. Spinal CXCR2 antagonism impairs allodynia and iron overload following fracture surgery. Intrathecal delivery of recombinant CXCL1 induces acute allodynia and spinal iron overload, which is reversed by hydrogen-rich saline. Moreover, iron chelation alleviates exogenous CXCL1-induced acute pain behaviors.

Hyperphosphorylated tau is considered to play a significant role in the progression of neurodegenerative disease and also contributes to cognitive dysfunction in septic mice. Molecular hydrogen (H2) plays an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory role, and plays a protective role in septic mice. This study explored the possible effects of H2 on cognition and tau phosphorylation in a mouse model of SAE. Methods: The model of sepsis was established in C57BL/6J male mice by cecal ligation and puncture surgery. Mice treated with 2 % H2 inhalation for 60 min at 1 h and 6 h after surgery, respectively. HY-15769, the inhibitor of Tau Tubulin Kinase 1 (TTBK1), was injected 1 h before the surgery. The 7-day survival rates of the mice were recorded. Cognitive behavior was tested with both novel object recognition and the Y-maze novelty arm recognition on day 7 after surgery. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the histological damage in CA1 region of hippocampus. The expression of inflammatory factors in hippocampus was assessed by Elisa. Western blotting was adopted to determine the tau phosphorylation levels at AT8 epitopes (pSer202 and pThr205) and T22 epitopes (neurofibrillary tangle protein oligomer), and the GSK3β phosphorylation levels (Tyr216), as well as p-Ser422 and TTBK1 levels in the hippocampus.

Results: The survival rate, visual and spatial learning ability, and memory ability were improved in septic mice treated with H2. After H2 treatment, the density of dendritic spine, mushroom type of dendritic spine, and the number of normal hippocampal neurons were progressively elevated. H2 decreased the levels of phosphorylated tau protein, tau oligomer and TTBK1, as well as the phosphorylation of tau key kinase.

To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, narrow-bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2 S3 ) are selected as sonocatalysts and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, Pt nanoparticles help to capture sono-excited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH) as natural hole sacrificial agents can consume sono-excited holes, which greatly improves charge separation efficiency and promote the controllable and sustainable H2 generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt-Bi2 S3 nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2 under US irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2 and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia, thus synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment.

Model calculations show that for gases with high lipid/water partition coefficient, D in tissues containing lipid is underestimated by this method. Graham's law (inverse proportionality between D and square root of molecular mass) was found to represent a useful approximation for these gases. A better correlation, however, was obtained between D and the molecular diameter. ",Neutral,Rat,Whole Body,Hydrogen Biology,Hydrogen Safety,Gas,N/A,Ventilation,,,Germany

Hydrogen plays a role of antioxidation and anti-inflammation. Calcium and magnesium play an important role in reducing hypertension and antioxidant. Filtered water contains abundant hydrogen and a large number of other essential elements of the human body. We investigated the protective effects of filtered water on hypertensive mice. To establish hypertension model, ICR mice were administered with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) hydrochloride 64 mg/kg per day for 1 month. The hypertensive mice were, respectively, administered with pure water, tap water, and filtered water for 2 months. Lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymatic activity, endothelin-1 (ET-1), angiotensin II (Ang II), and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) were assessed. Expressions of phosphorylated NF-κB P65 in the kidney were analyzed by western blot. qRT-PCR analysis was adopted to determine the expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines and NF-κB P65. The results demonstrated that filtered water can reduce the blood pressure. Filtered water treatment restored the activity of antioxidant enzymes, downregulated ET-1, and Ang II in the serum of mice. Filtered water treatment suppressed proinflammatory cytokines and decreased the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and NF-κB P65. Consumption of filtered water inhibited the expression of NF-κB P65. This suggests that filtered water can reduce the blood pressure. The protection mechanisms include downregulating oxidative stress and inhibiting inflammation, which is partly due to the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.",Positive,Mouse,Heart,Hypertension,Cardiac Hypertrophy,Water (Filtered),Neutral,Ingestion,,,China

Autophagy disorder is an important factor in the mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury. As the smallest molecule in nature, hydrogen has various biological effects such as anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis and regulation of autophagy. Hydrogen therapy is currently considered to be an emerging therapeutic method, but the effect and mechanism of hydrogen on doxorubicin-induced myocardial injury have not been determined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of hydrogen inhalation on doxorubicin-induced chronic myocardial injury and its effect and mechanism on autophagy. Methods: In this study, we established a chronic heart injury model by intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin in rats for 30 days, accumulating 20 mg/kg. The effect of hydrogen inhalation on the cardiac function in rats was explored by echocardiography, Elisa, and H&E staining. To clarify the influence of autophagy, we detected the expression of LC3 and related autophagy proteins in vivo and in vitro by immunofluorescence and western blot.In order to further explore the mechanism of autophagy, we added pathway inhibitors and used western blot to preliminarily investigate the protective effect of hydrogen inhalation on myocardial injury caused by doxorubicin. Results: Hydrogen inhalation can improve doxorubicin-induced cardiac function decline and pathological structural abnormalities in rats. It was confirmed by immunofluorescence that hydrogen treatment could restore the expression of autophagy marker protein LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) in cardiomyocytes reduced by doxorubicin, while reducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mechanistically, Western blot results consistently showed that hydrogen treatment up-regulated the ratio of p-AMPK (phosphorylated AMP-dependent protein kinase) to AMPK and down-regulated p-mTOR (phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin) and mTOR ratio. Conclusions: These results suggest that hydrogen inhalation can activate autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway and protect against myocardial injury induced by doxorubicin.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of molecular hydrogen on the local therapy of a II degree burn wound with the intensification of collagen fibrillogenesis in the skin. We analyzed the involvement of mast cells (MCs) in the regeneration of the collagen fibers of the connective tissue using water with a high content of molecular hydrogen and in a therapeutic ointment for the cell wounds. Thermal burns led to an increase in the skin MC population, accompanied by a systemic rearrangement of the extracellular matrix. The use of molecular hydrogen for the treatment of burn wounds stimulated the regeneration processes by activating the formation of the fibrous component of the dermis, accelerating wound healing. Thus, the intensification of collagen fibrillogenesis was comparable to the effects of a therapeutic ointment. The remodeling of the extracellular matrix correlated with a decrease in the area of damaged skin. Skin regeneration induced by the activation of the secretory activity of MCs may be one of the possible points of implementation of the biological effects of molecular hydrogen in the treatment of burn wounds. Thus, the positive effects of molecular hydrogen on skin repair can be used in clinical practice to increase the effectiveness of therapy after thermal exposure.

Hydrogen gas (H2) is a therapeutic medical gas with multiple functions such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation, anti-cell death, and the stimulation of energy metabolism. To develop a disease-modifying treatment for AD through multifactorial mechanisms, an open label pilot study on H2 treatment was conducted. (2) Methods: Eight patients with AD inhaled 3% H2 gas for one hour twice daily for 6 months and then followed for 1 year without inhaling H2 gas. The patients were clinically assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). To objectively assess the neuron integrity, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to neuron bundles passing through the hippocampus. (3) Results: The mean individual ADAS-cog change showed significant improvement after 6 months of H2 treatment (-4.1) vs. untreated patients (+2.6). As assessed by DTI, H2 treatment significantly improved the integrity of neurons passing through the hippocampus vs. the initial stage. The improvement by ADAS-cog and DTI assessments were maintained during the follow-up after 6 months (significantly) or 1 year (non-significantly).

Hydrogen (H2) is a novel and effective antiinflammatory agent. The present study was aimed to clarify the effects of 4% H2 inhalation on NAFLD and its mechanism of action. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks to induce NAFLD. Rats in treatment group inhaled 4% H2 each day for 2 h. The protective effects on hepatic histopathology, glucose tolerance, inflammatory markers, and intestinal epithelial tight junctions were assessed. Transcriptome sequencing of liver and 16 S-seq of cecal contents were also performed to explore the related mechanisms of H2 inhalation. H2 improved the hepatic histological changes and glucose tolerance, decreased the liver function parameters of plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and relieved liver inflammation. Liver transcriptomic data suggested that H2 treatment significantly downregulated inflammatory response genes, and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4/nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway might be involved, and the expressions of critical proteins were further validated. Meanwhile, the plasma LPS level was significantly decreased by the H2 intervention. H2 also improved the intestinal tight junction barrier by enhancing the expressions of zonula occludens-1 and occluding. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, H2 altered the composition of gut microbiota, improving the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes. Collectively, our data show that H2 could prevent NAFLD induced by high-fat diet, and the anti-NAFLD effect is associated with the modulation of gut microbiota and inhibition of LPS/TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory pathway.

However, its effect on alveolar macrophage (AM) pyroptosis induced by burns is still unclear. The purpose of this research was to study the possible positive effects of hydrogen on burn-induced lung injury and the effects of hydrogen on AM pyroptosis during acute lung injury (ALI) induced by burns. Methods: In this study, histological changes in rat lungs in vivo were evaluated by micro-CT, and histological changes in isolated lungs were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The expressions of leucine rich repeat (LRR) and pyrin domain (PYD) containing protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase-1 and Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) were analyzed by Western blotting. The expression of GSDMD was measured by immunofluorescence to evaluate the levels of lung inflammation and pyroptosis. The level of inflammation was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pyroptosis was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Results: We observed that severe burn resulted in increased IL-1β and IL-18, overexpression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 proteins, and pyroptosis in rat lung tissues, as demonstrated by GSDMD overexpression and electron microscopy of AMs. We also observed that hydrogen treatment partially reversed the increase in lung tissue density and reduced pulmonary inflammation. Moreover, hydrogen reduced the HE pathological injury score in the lung tissues of severely burned rats. Hydrogen treatment significantly reduced the contents of IL-1β and IL-18 in the lung tissues and decreased the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1 and GSDMD proteins compared with the burn group. Transmission electron microscopy results also showed that the number of AM membrane pores was significantly reduced in the hydrogen treatment group.

Currently, no effective treatment for sepsis is available. Hydrogen plays a protective role in different diseases; however, the detailed mechanism of hydrogen-treated disease remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of hydrogen on SAE in vitro and in vivo and the mechanism of hydrogen in mitochondrial dynamics and its function in astrocytes and microglia stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). Methods: Animal models of SAE were generated by cecal ligation and puncture, and the SAE model was established by in vitro LPS stimulation. MTT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and cell apoptosis assays were used to determine the effect of hydrogen on astrocytes and microglia stimulated by LPSs. The relationships between nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), YY1, and HO-1 were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation. Mitochondrial homeostasis-related proteins in LPS-stimulated glial cells and brain tissues of SAE mice were detected by western blotting. The effects of hydrogen treatment in the SAE mouse model were investigated using Morris water maze and Y-maze analyses. Results: After performing experiments with different concentrations of LPSs in vitro, we selected 1000 ng/ml for subsequent experiments. Hydrogen attenuated the increase in ROS, LDH, and apoptosis and promoted decreases in cell activity and MMP, further promoting an increase in HO-1 expression induced by LPSs in astrocytes and microglia. Moreover, hydrogen further promoted the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, PGC-1α, TFAM, PARKIN, and PINK1, inhibited LPS-induced OPA1 and MFN2 expression in astrocytes and microglia, and downregulated the expression of DRP1 after LPS induction. Intriguingly, hydrogen treatment enhanced the binding between Nrf2 and YY1. However, silencing Nrf2 or YY1 abolished the protective effects of hydrogen on cell activity, LDH, ROS, and MMP; apoptosis; and regulation of Nrf2, HO-1, PGC-1α, TFAM, OPA1, DRP1, MFN2, PARKIN, and PINK1 in microglia. Finally, hydrogen treatment improved the results of behavioral detection, apoptosis, Nrf2, HO-1, PGC-1α, TFAM, OPA1, DRP1, MFN2, PARKIN, PINK1, and cytokines in SAE in vivo. Conclusions: Hydrogen improved cell injury and mitochondrial quality, which were associated with HO-1 expression promoted by the Nrf2/YY1 complex in vitro.

Methods: HYBRID II is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed at 15 hospitals in Japan, between February 1, 2017, and September 30, 2021. Patients aged 20-80 years with coma following cardiogenic OHCA were randomly assigned (1:1) using blinded gas cylinders to receive supplementary oxygen with 2% H2 or oxygen (control) for 18 h. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a 90-day Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 1 or 2 assessed in a full-analysis set. Secondary outcomes included the 90-day score on a modified Rankin scale (mRS) and survival. HYBRID II was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (registration number: UMIN000019820) and re-registered with the Japan Registry for Clinical Trials (registration number: jRCTs031180352). Findings: The trial was terminated prematurely because of the restrictions imposed on enrolment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between February 1, 2017, and September 30, 2021, 429 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 73 were randomly assigned to H2 (n = 39) or control (n = 34) groups. The primary outcome, i.e., a CPC of 1 or 2 at 90 days, was achieved in 22 (56%) and 13 (39%) patients in the H2 and control groups (relative risk compared with the control group, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.46-1.13; P = 0.15), respectively.

H2 has been shown to effectively protect cells and tissues from oxidative and inflammatory damage. While comprehensive effects and how H2 functions in wound healing remains unknown, especially for the link between H2 and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) activation. Methods: Here, we established a cutaneous aseptic wound model and applied a high concentration of H2 (66% H2) in a treatment chamber. Molecular mechanisms and the effects of healing were evaluated by gene functional enrichment analysis, digital spatial profiler analysis, blood perfusion/oxygen detection assay, in vitro tube formation assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescent staining, non-targeted metabonomic analysis, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscope, and live-cell imaging. Results: We revealed that a high concentration of H2 (66% H2) greatly increased the healing rate (3 times higher than the control group) on day 11 post-wounding. The effect was not dependent on O2 or anti-reactive oxygen species functions. Histological and cellular experiments proved the fast re-epithelialization in the H2 group. ECM components early (3 days post-wounding) deposition were found in the H2 group of the proximal wound, especially for the dermal col-I, epidermal col-III, and dermis-epidermis-junction col-XVII. H2 accelerated early autologous EpSCs proliferation (1-2 days in advance) and then differentiation into myoepithelial cells. These epidermal myoepithelial cells could further contribute to ECM deposition. Other beneficial outcomes include sustained moist healing, greater vascularization, less T-helper-1 and T-helper-17 cell-related systemic inflammation, and better tissue remodelling. Conclusion: We have discovered a novel pattern of wound healing induced by molecular hydrogen treatment.

Lungs are among the organs that are affected in MOF, resulting in acute lung injury. A large number of inflammatory factors and stress injury in sepsis can lead to alterations in mitochondrial dynamics. Numerous studies have confirmed that hydrogen can alleviate sepsis in the animal model. The purpose of this experiment was to explore the therapeutic effect of high concentration (67%) hydrogen on acute lung injury in septic mice and its mechanism. Methods: The moderate and severe septic models were prepared by cecal ligation and puncture. Hydrogen with different concentrations was inhaled for one hour at 1 h and 6 h after the corresponding surgery. The arterial blood gas of mice during hydrogen inhalation was monitored in real time, and the 7-day survival rate of mice with sepsis was recorded. The pathological changes of lung tissues and functions of livers and kidneys were measured. The changes of oxidation products, antioxidant enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines in lungs and serums were detected. Mitochondrial function was measured. Results: The inhalation of 2% or 67% hydrogen improves the 7-day survival rate and reduces acute lung injury as well as liver and kidney injury in sepsis. The therapeutic effect of 67% hydrogen inhalation on sepsis was related to increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, reducing oxidation products and pro-inflammatory cytokines in lungs and serums. Compared with the Sham group, mitochondrial dysfunction was alleviated in hydrogen groups. Conclusions: Hydrogen inhalation by high or low concentration can both significantly improve sepsis; however, a high concentration demonstrates a better protective effect. High concentration hydrogen inhalation can significantly improve the mitochondrial dynamic balance and reduce the lung injury in septic mice.

Hydrogen (H2) can reduce neuroinflammation; therefore, we hypothesize that H2 may alleviate postoperative pain, and aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism. Methods: Mice were used to establish a postoperative pain model using plantar incision surgery. Mechanical allodynia was measured using the von Frey test. Cell signaling was assayed using gelatin zymography, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining. Animals or BV-2 cells were received with/without ASK1 and Trx1 inhibitors to investigate the effects of H2 on microglia. Results: Plantar incision surgery increased MMP-9 activity and ASK1 phosphorylation in the spinal cord of mice. MMP-9 knockout and the ASK1 inhibitor, NQDI-1, attenuated postoperative pain. H2 increased the expression of Trx1 in the spinal cord and in BV-2 cells. H2 treatment mimicked NQDI1 in decreasing the phosphorylation of ASK1, p38 and JNK. It also reduced MMP-9 activity, downregulated pro-IL-1β maturation and IBA-1 expression in the spinal cord of mice, and ameliorated postoperative pain. The protective effects of H2 were abolished by the Trx1 inhibitor, PX12. In vitro, in BV-2 cells, H2 also mimicked NQDI1 in inhibiting the phosphorylation of ASK1, p38, and JNK, and also reduced MMP-9 activity and decreased IBA-1 expression induced by LPS. The Trx1 inhibitor, PX12, abolished the protective effects of H2 in BV-2 cells.

Methods: This observational, non-interventional, retrospective, double-arm, 6-month clinical study included T2DM patients receiving conventional anti-diabetes medication with or without HI initiation from 2018 to 2021. Patients were assigned to the HI group or non-HI group (control group) after 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). The mean change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 6 months in different groups was evaluated primarily. The secondary outcome was composed of the mean change of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), weight, lipid profile, and homeostasis model assessment. Logistics regression was performed to evaluate the likelihood of reaching different HbA1c levels after 6-month treatment between the groups. Adverse event (AE) was also evaluated in patients of both groups. Results: In total, 1088 patients were selected into the analysis. Compared to the control group, subjects in HI group maintained greater improvement in the level of HbA1c (-0.94% vs -0.46%), FPG (-22.7 mg/dL vs -11.7 mg/dL), total cholesterol (-12.9 mg/dL vs -4.4 mg/dL), HOMA-IR (-0.76 vs -0.17) and HOMA-β (8.2% vs 1.98%) with all p< 0.001 post the treatment. Logistics regression revealed that the likelihood of reaching HbA1c< 7%, ≥ 7% to< 8% and > 1% reduction at the follow-up period was higher in the HI group, while patients in the control group were more likely to attain HbA1c ≥ 9%. Patients in HI group was observed a lower incidence of several AEs including hypoglycemia (2.0% vs 6.8%), vomiting (2.6% vs 7.4%), constipation (1.7% vs 4.4%) and giddiness (3.3% vs 6.3%) with significance in comparison to the control group.

In the current study, we investigated the influence of intermittent environmental exposure to hydrogen gas at a safe concentration (1.3%) on photoaging using an ultraviolet A (UVA)-irradiated murine model. Methods: To mimic the expected human daily activity cycle, UVA exposure in the daytime and hydrogen exposure in the night-time, an original design, UVA-transmission, hydrogen-exposure system was established. Mice were bred under experimental conditions of UVA irradiation and normal air for 8 h (outdoor time 09.00-17.00 hours), and UVA non-irradiation and inhalation of hydrogen gas for 16 h (indoor time 17.00-09.00 hours), and the daily cycle was continued for up to 6 weeks. The progression of photoaging, including morphological changes, collagen degradation and UVA-related DNA damage, was evaluated. Results: Intermittent administration of hydrogen gas by our system prevented UVA-induced epidermal signs, such as hyperplasia, melanogenesis and appearance of senescence cells, and UVA-induced dermal signs, such as collagen degradation. In addition, we detected attenuation of DNA damage in the hydrogen exposure group as indirect evidence that intermittent exposure to hydrogen gas reduced oxidative stress.

Molecular hydrogen can scavenge intracellular hydroxyl radicals, acting as an antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory agent. We seek to assess the capability of molecular hydrogen to ameliorate brain damage induced by electromagnetic radiation. Methods: NEMP (nuclear electromagnetic pulse), a subset of electromagnetic pulse with high voltage value that could cause severe brain injury, was applied to this study. Male wild-type rats were divided into four groups: the control group, the H2 (Molecular hydrogen) group, the NEMP group and the NEMP+H2 group. Rats in the H2 group and the NEMP+H2 group were fed with saturated hydrogen-rich water from 3 days before NEMP exposure (electromagnetic field intensity 400 kV/m, rising edge 20 ns and pulse width 200 ns) to the day of sacrifice. One day after exposure, animal behavior experiments were performed, and samples for transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis were collected. Seven days after exposure, histopathological experiments were conducted. Results: The data from the elevated plus maze and the open field test showed that NEMP exposure elicited anxiety-like behavior in rats, which could be alleviated by H2 treatment. Histopathological results manifested that NEMP exposure-induced injuries of the neurons in the hippocampus and amygdala could be attenuated by H2 treatment. Transcriptomic results revealed that NEMP exposure had a profound effect on microtubule structure in the brain. And the combined analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics showed that H2 has a significant impact on the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, synaptic vesicle cycle and synapse etc. Moreover, it was indicated that the glutathione metabolic pathway played a vital role in the NEMP exposure-induced damage and the protective activity of H2.

Hydrogen (H2) is a small gas with a high reducing ability, and plenty of recent studies have demonstrated its therapeutic effect on many diseases. However, the antibacterial effectiveness and mechanism of H2 against MDR bacteria are still unknown. In the present work, using PdH nanohydride with a temperature responsive H2-releasing property as the H2 source, we demonstrated that H2 was not only able to inhibit the growth of normal Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), but could also effectively eliminate single drug resistant S. aureus (CRSA) and multidrug resistant S. aureus (MRSA), as well as the biofilms formed by those bacteria. Moreover, an in-depth mechanism regarding the anti-antibiotic-resistance activity of H2 was elucidated by us, in which H2 exerted its antibacterial effect by firstly causing severe membrane damage, followed by boosting generation of intracellular ROS, which subsequently triggered DNA damage and finally led to bacterial death. The proposed mechanism was further verified by genomic analysis, where a cluster of genes related to bacterial membrane integrity, biofilm formation, metabolism and DNA functions was significantly perturbed by the released H2. In particular, H2 boosted intracellular ROS generation by destroying the redox homeostasis of bacterial metabolism. More importantly, we revealed that H2 was able to alleviate the antibiotic resistance of CRSA and MRSA by significantly down-regulating the expression of many drug-resistant genes, e.g. the norG gene of CRSA, and fmtA, gpsB, sarA and marR genes of MRSA, as well as reducing the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin/ampicillin against CRSA/MRSA.

The present study demonstrated that H2 inhalation ameliorated liver injury, and attenuated liver oxidative stress, inflammation, and steatosis in an ALD mouse model. Moreover, H2 inhalation improved gut microbiota, including increasing the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Clostridia, and decreasing the abundance of Prevotellaceae and Muribaculaceae, and also improved intestinal barrier integrity.

Thus, additional strategies are required to improve the efficacy of transplanted cells in the treatment of SCI. Hydrogen possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether hydrogen can enhance the effect of BMSC transplantation in the treatment of SCI has not yet been reported. This study was aimed at investigating whether hydrogen promotes the therapeutic effect of BMSC transplantation in the treatment of SCI in rats. In vitro, BMSCs were cultured in a normal medium and a hydrogen-rich medium to study the effect of hydrogen on the proliferation and migration of BMSCs. BMSCs were treated with a serum-deprived medium (SDM), and the effects of hydrogen on the apoptosis of BMSCs were studied. In vivo, BMSCs were injected into the rat model of SCI.

The experimental groups were the immediately reperfused control group (CT), the CS with University of Wisconsin solution (UW) group, the CS with Dsol group, the CS with UW and post-reperfusion H2 treatment group (UW-H2), and the CS with Dsol and post-reperfusion H2 group (Dsol-H2). We first compared the Dsol-H2, UW, and CT groups to evaluate this alternative method to conventional CS. The protective potential of the Dsol-H2 group was superior to that of the UW group, as evidenced by lower portal venous resistance and lactate dehydrogenase leakage, a higher oxygen consumption rate, and increased bile production. Multiple comparison tests among the UW, Dsol, UW-H2, and Dsol-H2 groups revealed that both treatments, during CS and after reperfusion, conferred a similar extent of protection and showed additive effects in combination therapy.

Our objective is to test the hypothesis that H2 inhalation reduces L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. 15 days after 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of dopaminergic neurons were made (microinjection into the medial forebrain bundle), chronic L-DOPA treatment (15 days) was performed. Rats were exposed to H2 (2% gas mixture, 1 h) or air (controls) before L-DOPA injection. Abnormal involuntary movements and locomotor activity were conducted. Striatal microglia and astrocyte was analyzed and striatal and plasma samples for cytokines evaluation were collected after the abnormal involuntary movements analysis. H2 inhalation attenuated L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. The gas therapy did not impair the improvement of locomotor activity achieved by L-DOPA treatment. H2 inhalation reduced activated microglia in the lesioned striatum, which is consistent with the observed reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines levels. Display of abnormal involuntary movements was positively correlated with plasma IL-1β and striatal TNF-α levels and negatively correlated with striatal IL-10 levels. Prophylactic H2 inhalation decreases abnormal involuntary movements in a preclinical L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia model.

Hydrogen (H2) enhances tolerance to an announced ischemic event; however, the therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of CI/R injury remain uncertain. Long non-coding RNA lincRNA-erythroid prosurvival (EPS) (lincRNA-EPS) regulate various biological processes, but their involvement in the effects of H2 and their associated underlying mechanisms still needs clarification. Herein, we examine the function of the lincRNA-EPS/Sirt1/autophagy pathway in the neuroprotection of H2 against CI/R injury. HT22 cells and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model were used to mimic CI/R injury in vitro. H2, 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor), and RAPA (an autophagy agonist) were then administered, respectively. Autophagy, neuro-proinflammation, and apoptosis were evaluated by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence staining, real-time PCR, and flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that H2 attenuated HT22 cell injury, which would be confirmed by the improved cell survival rate and decreased levels of lactate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, H2 remarkably improved cell injury after OGD/R insult via decreasing pro-inflammatory factors, as well as suppressing apoptosis. Intriguingly, the protection of H2 against neuronal OGD/R injury was abolished by rapamycin. Importantly, the ability of H2 to promote lincRNA-EPS and Sirt1 expression and inhibit autophagy were abrogated by the siRNA-lincRNA-EPS. Taken together, the findings proved that neuronal cell injury caused by OGD/R is efficiently prevented by H2 via modulating lincRNA-EPS/Sirt1/autophagy-dependent pathway.

Methods: Left donor lungs were inflated using 40% oxygen + 60% nitrogen (O group), or 3% hydrogen + 40% oxygen + 57% nitrogen (H group). Donor lungs were deflated in the control group and were harvested immediately after perfusion in the sham group (n = 10).

Methods: After one week of adaptive feeding, Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: the general diet group (CHOW), the high methionine group (HMD), and the high methionine plus hydrogen rich water group (HMD+HRW), with 8 rats in each group. The CHOW group was fed with AIN-93G feed, while the HMD and HMD+HRW groups were fed with AIN-93G+2% methionine feed to construct an HHcy model. The HMD+HRW group was also gavaged with hydrogen rich water (3 ml/animal, twice a day, with a hydrogen concentration of 0.8 mmol/L), and body weight data were recorded. After 6 weeks of feeding, the plasma and liver samples were processed and collected. The plasma homocysteine (Hcy) and lipid contents of each group were measured, and the histological morphology of the liver was observed. The activities of key enzymes in the Hcy metabolism pathway and mRNA expression were detected in the liver. Results: Compared with the CHOW group rats, the Hcy level in the blood of HMD rats was significantly increased significantly (P＜0.05). Pathological tissue sections showed liver enlargement, injury, and fatty liver in the rats; Compared with the HMD group rats, the HMD+HRW group rats showed a significant decrease in Hcy in the blood, reduced liver damage, and increased Hcy metabolism key enzyme activity and mRNA expression in the liver, with statistical differences (P＜0.05).

Radiotherapy and surgical removal are the most commonly used therapeutic modalities, and nanomedicine has lately entered this field. Brachytherapy using Ruthenium-106 (106 Ru) ophthalmic plaques has been used for decades to treat ocular melanoma, with the applicator placed on the patient's eyes until the prescribed dose reaches the tumor apex. Purpose: To investigate the efficiency of hydrogen nanobubbles (H2 -NBs) employment during intraocular melanoma brachytherapy using a 106 Ru electron emitter plaque. Methods: The Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and experimental investigation using a 3D-designed phantom and thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD) were employed. Various concentrations of H2 -NBs with a diameter of 100 nm were simulated inside tumor tissue. The results were presented as deposited energy and dose enhancement factor (DEF). An equivalent Resin phantom of the human eyeball was made using AutoCAD and 3D-Printer technologies. The glass-bead TLDs dosimeter were employed and placed inside the phantom. Results: Using a 1% concentration of H2 -NBs, a DEF of 93% and 98% were achieved at the tumor apex of 10 mm from the experimental setup and MC simulation, respectively. For simulated concentrations of 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 1%, and 4% H2 -NBs, a maximum dose enhancement of 154%, 174%, 188%, 200%, and 300% were achieved, respectively, and a dose reduction was seen at about 3 mm from the plaque surface. Conclusion: H2 -NBs can be used as an absorbed dose enhancer in 106 Ru eye brachytherapy because of their unique physical characteristics. Reducing plaque implantation time on the patient's eye, reducing sclera absorbed dose, and decreasing the risk of patients' healthy organs irradiation are reported as some of the potential benefits of using H2-NBs.

In this study, quantitative proteomics acquired from a mouse model were first analyzed. At the same time, functional pathway analysis helped identify functional pathways at the protein level. Then, bioinformatics on mRNA sequencing data were conducted between sepsis and normal mouse models. Differential expressional genes with the closest relationship to disease status and development were identified through module correlation analysis. Then, common biomarkers in proteomics and transcriptomics were extracted as target biomarkers.

Effective treatment of SNHL often requires multifaceted approach due to the complex pathology, and drug combination therapy is expected to be at the forefront of modern hearing loss treatment. Here, space-station-like composite nanoparticles (CCC@mPP NPs) with pH/oxidation dual responsiveness and multidrug simultaneous delivery capability were constructed and then loaded with various drugs including panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), tanshinone IIA (TSIIA), and ammonia borane (AB) to provide robust protection against SNHL. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that carboxymethyl chitosan/calcium carbonate-chitosan (CCC) NPs and monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-PLGA (mPP) NPs can rendezvous and dock primarily by hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic forces may be involved. Moreover, CCC@mPP NPs crossed the round window membrane (RWM) and entered the inner ear through endocytosis and paracellular pathway. The docking state was basically maintained during this process, which created favorable conditions for multidrug delivery. This nanosystem was highly sensitive to pH and reactive oxygen species (ROS) changes, as evidenced by the restricted release of payload at alkaline condition (pH 7.4) without ROS, while significantly promoting the release in acidic condition (pH 5.0 and 6.0) with ROS. TSIIA/PNS/AB-loaded CCC@mPP NPs almost completely preserved the hair cells and remained the hearing threshold shift within normal limits in aminoglycoside- or CDDP-treated guinea pigs. Further experiments demonstrated that the protective mechanisms of TSIIA/PNS/AB-loaded CCC@mPP NPs involved direct and indirect scavenging of excessive ROS, and reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed the high biocompatibility of the composite NPs, even after long-term administration. Collectively, this work suggests that composite NPs is an ideal multi-drug-delivery vehicle and open new avenues for inner ear disease therapies.

The involvement of the Central Nervous System (CNS) during sepsis has received considerable attention, especially the hippocampus which plays a key role in the learning and memory processes. The increased interest in this limbic region during systemic inflammation (SI) is related to the number of sepsis survivor patients who have cognitive impairments. A single injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation is the most commonly used murine endotoxemia model because it replicates several pathophysiological changes observed in severe sepsis. Molecular hydrogen (H2) has been used as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy to prevent neuroinflammation. However, the mechanisms by which inhaled H2 mitigate memory loss during SI remains unknown. To understand how H2 acts in the hippocampus, the current study focused on specific mechanisms that may be involved in reducing neuroinflammation in rats during SI. We hypothesized that inhaled H2 decreases LPS-induced hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokines surges and this effect is associated with reduced memory loss. Using different and integrative approaches, i.e., from hippocampal cells electrophysiology to animal behavior, we report that inhaled H2 decreased LPS-induced peripheral and hippocampal inflammation, decreased microglial and astrocytic activation, lessen memory loss without affecting long-term potentiation (LTP).

Hydrogen effectively combats oxidative stress and inflammation and reportedly inhibits ischemia-reperfusion injury in various organs. Unfortunately, with conventional methods of hydrogen administration, incorporating hydrogen continuously into the body over a long period of time is difficult. We hypothesized that a Silicon (Si)-based agent we recently developed would aid in fat grafting as it can generate large amounts of hydrogen continuously in the body. Methods: Fat grafting was performed on the backs of rats fed either a normal or 1.0 wt% Si-based agent-containing diet. To investigate synergistic effects with adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs), which improve retention rates of fat grafting, fat grafting with ASCs (1.0×10 5/400 mg fat) was also performed in each rat. Postoperative retention rates of grafted fat over time, inflammatory indices, apoptosis and oxidative stress markers, histological findings, and expression levels of inflammation-related cytokines and growth factors were compared between the four groups. Results: Intake of Si-based agent and addition of ASCs significantly reduced inflammatory indices, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of grafted fat, and improved long-term retention rates, histological parameters, and grafted fat quality. Under our experimental conditions, intake of the Si-based agent and addition of ASCs yielded comparable improvements in fat graft retention. Combining the two enhanced these effects even further. Conclusion: Oral administration of the hydrogen-generating Si-based agent may improve grafted fat retention by regulating the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in grafted fat.

Results: Of the 431 patients comprised, it is observed a significant decrease in HbA1c level (9.04±0.82% at baseline to 8.30±0.99% and 8.00±0.80% at the end, p<0.001), FPG (165.6±40.2 mg/dL at baseline to 157.1±36.3mg/dL and 143.6±32.3mg/dL at the end, p<0.001), weight (74.7±7.1kg at baseline to 74.8±10.0kg and 73.6±8.1kg at the end, p<0.001), insulin dose (49.3±10.8U/d at baseline to 46.7±8.0U/d and 45.2±8.7U/d, p<0.001). The individuals in subgroup with higher baseline HbA1c and longer daily HI time duration gain greater HbA1c decrease after 6 months. Linear regression shows that higher baseline HbA1c level and shorter diabetes duration are significantly in relation to greater HbA1c reduction. Logistics regression reveals that lower weight is associated with a higher possibility of reaching HbA1c<7%. The most common adverse event is hypoglycemia. Conclusion: HI therapy significantly improves glycemic control, weight, insulin dose, lipid metabolism, β-cell function and insulin resistance of patients with type 2 diabetes after 6 months. Higher baseline HbA1c level and shorter diabetes duration is related to greater clinical response to HI.",Positive,Human,Whole Body,Diabetes (Type II),Glucose Metabolism,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,China

Mice with imiquimod-induced psoriasis were established and divided into groups. The mice were respectively treated with hydrogen-rich water bath and distilled water bath. The changes of skin lesions and PSI scores of mice were compared after their treatments. HE staining was used to observe the pathological feature. The changes of inflammatory indexes and immune factors were analysed by ELISA and immunohistochemical staining. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content was measured by the thiobarbituric assay (TBA) method. By naked eye, the severity of skin lesions in hydrogen-rich water bath group was lower than that in distilled water bath group, and the psoriasis severity index (PSI) was lower (p < 0.01). The results of HE staining showed that the mice with distilled water bath had more abnormal keratosis, thickening of the spinous layer and prolongation of the dermal process, and more Munro abscess than the mice with hydrogen-rich water bath. During the course of disease, the overall levels and peaks of IL-17, IL-23, TNF-α, CD3+ and MDA in mice with hydrogen-rich bath were lower than those in mice with distilled water bath (p < 0.05). In the skin, the mice treated with the hydrogen-rich water bath also had lower peak of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) levels. It is concluded that hydrogen-rich water bath can inhibit psoriasis inflammation and oxidative stress, relieve psoriasis skin lesions and accelerate the end of abnormal skin proliferation state, which shows a therapeutic and improving effect on psoriasis.

However, effective etiological therapy for POF is scarce. Thus, we aimed to explore the protective role and targets of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in POF. Methods: Based on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced POF rat models, the protective role of HRW treatment was mainly determined through serum 17-β-estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, ovarian histomorphological analysis, and TUNEL assay. Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis was then conducted on ovarian tissues, and the targets of HRW in POF were identified integrating differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and interaction analysis. Results: In HRW treatment of POF rats, the serum AMH and E2 levels significantly increased, and FSH level significantly reduced, indicating the protective role of HRW. After TMT quantitative proteomic analysis, a total of 16 candidate differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified after the cross analysis of DEPs from POF vs. control and POF+HRW vs. POF groups, which were found to be significantly enriched in 296 GO terms and 36 KEGG pathways. The crucial targets, RT1-Db1 and RT1-Bb, were finally identified based on both protein-protein interaction network and GeneMANIA network. Conclusions: The HRW treatment could significantly alleviate the ovarian injury of POF rats; RT1-Db1 and RT1-Bb are identified as two crucial targets of HRW treatment in POF rats.",Positive,Rat,Ovaries,Premature Ovarian Failure,Oxidative Stress,Water (Electrolysis),Neutral,Ingestion,,,China

The elimination of the iron pool for the removal of Fenton reactions is vitally important to prevent the evolution of NAFLD, but quite challenging. In this work, we discover that free heme in the iron pool of NAFLD can catalyze the hydrogenation of H2O2/‧OH to block the heme-based Fenton reaction for the first time, and therefore develop a novel hepatocyte-targeted hydrogen delivery system (MSN-Glu) by modifying magnesium silicide nanosheets (MSN) with N-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) gluconamide to block the heme-catalyzed vicious circle of liver disease. The developed MSN-Glu nanomedicine exhibits a high hydrogen delivery capacity as well as sustained hydrogen release and hepatocyte-targeting behaviors, and remarkably improves the metabolic function of the liver in a NAFLD mouse model by the relief of oxidative stress and the prevention of ferroptosis in hepatocytes, accelerating the removal of the iron pool in fundamental support of NAFLD prevention. The proposed prevention strategy based on the mechanisms of NAFLD disease and hydrogen medicine will provide an inspiration for inflammation-related disease prevention.

Methods: HT22 cells in logarithmic growth phase were cultured in vitro. Cell viability was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay to find the optimal concentration of Na2S2O4. HT22 cells were divided into control group (NC group), OGD/R group (sugar-free medium+10 mmol/L Na2S2O4 treated for 90 minutes and then changed to normal medium for 4 hours) and hydrogen-rich water treatment group (HW group, sugar-free medium+10 mmol/L Na2S2O4 treated for 90 minutes and then changed to medium containing hydrogen-rich water for 4 hours). The morphology of HT22 cells was observed by inverted microscopy; cell activity was detected by CCK-8 method; cell ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy; the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and Beclin-1 was detected by immunofluorescence; the protein expression of LC3II/I and Beclin-1, markers of cellular autophagy, was detected by Western blotting. Results: Inverted microscopy showed that compared with the NC group, the OGD/R group had poor cell status, swollen cytosol, visible cell lysis fragments and significantly lower cell activity [(49.1±2.7)% vs. (100.0±9.7)%, P < 0.01]; compared with the OGD/R group, the HW group had improved cell status and remarkably higher cell activity [(63.3±1.8)% vs. (49.1±2.7)%, P < 0.01]. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the neuronal nuclear membrane of cells in the OGD/R group was lysed and a higher number of autophagic lysosomes were visible compared with the NC group; compared with the OGD/R group, the neuronal damage of cells in the HW group was reduced and the number of autophagic lysosomes was notably decreased. The results of immunofluorescence assay showed that the expressions of LC3 and Beclin-1 were outstandingly enhanced in the OGD/R group compared with the NC group, and the expressions of LC3 and Beclin-1 were markedly weakened in the HW group compared with the OGD/R group. Western blotting assay showed that the expressions were prominently higher in both LC3II/I and Beclin-1 in the OGD/R group compared with the NC group (LC3II/I: 1.44±0.05 vs. 0.37±0.03, Beclin-1/β-actin: 1.00±0.02 vs. 0.64±0.01, both P < 0.01); compared with the OGD/R group, the protein expression of both LC3II/I and Beclin-1 in the HW group cells were notably lower (LC3II/I: 0.54±0.02 vs. 1.44±0.05, Beclin-1/β-actin: 0.83±0.07 vs. 1.00±0.02, both P < 0.01).

The function of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is to activate the inflammatory process. Recent findings suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential secondary messengers that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Hydrogen-rich saline (HS) has attracted attention for its anti-inflammatory properties. However, the protective effect and possible mechanism of HSin brain ischemia have not been well elucidated. Methods: To test the therapeutic effect of HS, we established a mouse model of distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) and an in vitro model of BV2 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of HS. Results: HS significantly improved neurological function, reduced infarct volume, and increased cerebral blood flow in a dMCAO mouse model.

H2 gas inhalation is reportedly safe and has a positive impact on a range of illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we investigated the effects of 4 weeks of H2 gas inhalation on community-dwelling adults of various ages. Fifty-four participants, including those who dropped out (5%), were screened and enrolled. The selected participants were treated as a single group without randomization. We evaluated the association between total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts and AD risk at individual levels after 4 weeks of H2 gas inhalation treatment. The total and differential WBC counts were not adversely affected after H2 gas inhalation, indicating that it was safe and well tolerated. Investigation of oxidative stress markers such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide showed that their levels decreased post-treatment. Furthermore, evaluation of dementia-related biomarkers, such as beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1), amyloid beta (Aβ), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), T-tau, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6), showed that their cognitive condition significantly improved after treatment, in most cases.

Therefore, we hypothesized that hydrogen/oxygen therapy for ordinary coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients might reduce the length of hospitalization and increase hospital discharge rates. Methods: This retrospective, propensity-score matched (PSM) case-control study included 180 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 3 centers. After assigned in 1:2 ratios by PSM, 33 patients received hydrogen/oxygen therapy and 55 patients received oxygen therapy included in this study. Primary endpoint was the length of hospitalization.

However, the passive diffusion in traditional delivery systems greatly retards the approach and penetration of drugs into hepatocellular carcinoma cells and thus hinders the efficacy of combination therapy. Micro/nanomotors with autonomous locomotion in a tiny scale provide the possibility of tackling this issue. Herein, an active drug delivery micromotor platform delicately designed to load drugs with different physicochemical properties and enhance the drug permeability of cells is demonstrated for HCC chemotherapy treatment. The biocompatible micromotor platform Mg/PLGA/CHI comprised magnesium (Mg) coated with two polymer layers made of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and chitosan (CHI), where the hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs doxorubicin (Dox) and Curcumin (Cur) were loaded, respectively. The autonomous motion of the micromotors with velocity up to 45 μm s-1 greatly enhanced the diffusion of chemotherapeutic drugs and led to higher extracellular and intracellular drug distribution. Moreover, hydrogen produced during the motion eliminated the excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Compared with inert groups, the absorption of Dox and Cur from the active micromotors was about 2.9 and 1.5 times higher in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. In addition, the anti-tumor activity also obviously improved at the micromotor concentration of 1 mg mL-1 (cell proliferation was reduced by almost 30%). Overall, this work proposes an approach based on loading different chemotherapy agents on an active delivery system to enhance drug permeability and overcome MDR and provides a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC.

However, before incorporating MGH as a hydrogen-producing additive in broiler feed, it is crucial to fully understand its impact on microbiota and metabolites. In vitro fermentation models provide a fast, reproducible, and direct assessment tool for microbiota metabolism and composition. This study aims to investigate the effects of MGH and coated-magnesium hydride (CMG) on fermentation characteristics, as well as the microbiota and metabolome in the culture of in vitro fermentation using cecal inocula from broilers. After 48 h of incubation, it was observed that the presence of MGH had a significant impact on various factors. Specifically, the content of N-NH3 decreased, while the total hydrogen gas and total SCFAs increased. Furthermore, the presence of MGH promoted the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria such as Ruminococcus, Blautia, Coprobacillus, and Dysgonomonas. On the other hand, the presence of CMG led to an increase in the concentration of lactic acid, acetic acid, and valeric acid. Additionally, CMG affected the diversity of microbiota in the culture, resulting in an enrichment of the relative abundance of Firmicutes, as well as genera of Lactobacillus, Coprococcus, and Eubacterium. Conversely, the relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria and pathogenic bacteria Shigella decreased. Metabolome analysis revealed that MGH and CMG treatment caused significant changes in 21 co-regulated metabolites, primarily associated with lipid, amino acid, benzenoids, and organooxygen compounds. Importantly, joint correlation analysis revealed that MGH or CMG treatments had a direct impact on the microbiota, which in turn indirectly influenced metabolites in the culture. In summary, the results of this study suggested that both MGH and coated-MGH have similar yet distinct positive effects on the microbiota and metabolites of the broiler cecal in an in vitro fermentation model.

Our previous study demonstrated that hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) could scavenge free radicals selectively and alleviate the inflammatory response in the myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully clarified. Methods and results: Adult (10 weeks) C57BL/6 male mice and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were used to establish I/R and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury models. I/R and H/R models were treated with HRS to classify the mechanisms of cardioproctective function. In this study, we found that miR-124-3p was significantly decreased in both I/R and H/R models, while it was partially ameliorated by HRS pretreatment. HRS treatment also alleviated ischaemia-induced apoptotic cell death and increased cell viability during I/R process, whereas silencing expression of miR-124-3p abolished this protective effect. In addition, we identified calpain1 as a direct target of miR-124-3p, and up-regulation of miR-124-3 produced both activity and expression of calpain1. It was also found that compared with the HRS group, overexpression of calpain1 increased caspase-3 activities, promoted cleaved-caspase3 and Bax protein expressions, and correspondingly decreased Bcl-2, further reducing cell viability. These results illustrated that calpain1 overexpression attenuated protective effect of HRS on cardiomyocytes in H/R model.

Rats treated with HRS showed decreased TNF-α and IL-1β expression levels. HRS treatment enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPX) and decreased MDA and MPO activities. The number of MMP-9 and NLRP3 positive immunoreactivity cells decreased in the HRS-treated group. Subsequently, GFAP, IBA-1 and CD86 immunoreactivity were reduced, and CD206 increased after HRS treatment. 8-OHdG expression was decreased in the HRS-treated rats. Western blot analysis showed decreased NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, MMP-2/9, TLR4 and Bax protein levels after HRS treatment, while Bcl-2 expression increased after HRS treatment. These data demonstrated that HRS attenuated neuroinflammation, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, neuronal injury, and mitochondrial damage via NLRP3/Caspase-1/TLR4 signalling in the juvenile rat model, making it a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of paediatric SAE.

Methods: A 1.5-T single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess the tissue concentrations of relevant metabolites. Results: The mean glutamate and glutamate-plus-glutamine levels at the posterior cingulate gyrus decreased significantly during the study; this was accompanied by a significant drop in GABA levels at left prefrontal white matter, and glutathione levels at anterior cingulate gyrus. No changes in the brain metabolites were found in the comparable group of overweight individuals (n = 4, 2 women; age: 41.0 ±13.9, BMI 26.8 ±1.3 kg/m2) followed-up in the past without this treatment.

The effect of HRW intake on central corneal thickness (CCT) was also monitored. Subjects and methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers (5 men, 19 women) aged between 20 and 33 were included in the study, in which one eye of each subject was measured. The study was prospective, randomized and double-blind, with crossover design. Each subject underwent two parts of the experiment, each part on a different day and in random order. In each part of experiment, a total volume of 1260 ml of HRW or placebo was administered over 15 minutes in three doses. IOP and CCT were measured before and during the course of 75 minutes from the start of the HRW or placebo intake. Results: Administration of both HRW and the placebo caused a significant increase in IOP. The maximum IOP increase was 2.7 mmHg ±2.0 mmHg in minute 25 after the commencement of the experiment (HRW intake), and 1.4 mmHg ±2.0 mmHg in minute 35 (placebo intake). The values of IOP did not differ significantly between both parts, but there were significantly more clinically significant individual IOP increases after HRW intake (58%) compared to the placebo (25%). CCT did not change significantly during the experiment. Conclusion: The rapid intake of 1260 ml of both HRW and hydrogen-free water causes a statistically significant increase in IOP compared to the baseline in healthy individuals. In the case of HRW, the increase was also clinically significant in most of the subjects. Thus, the results indicate that acute intake of HRW may pose a higher risk than placebo intake in terms of IOP. However, in the case of risk groups such as subjects with glaucoma, ocular hypertension or suspected glaucoma, it is necessary to verify this conclusion by further studies.",Positive,Human,Eye,Intraocular Pressure,Corneal Thickness,Water (Electrolysis),Neutral,Ingestion,,,Czech Republic

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver pathology with increased fat accumulation in liver tissue caused by factors other than alcohol consumption. Platelet mitochondrial function is considered to reflect systemic mitochondrial health. We studied the effect of adjuvant therapy with hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) content and platelet mitochondrial bioenergetics in patients with NAFLD. A total of 30 patients with NAFLD and 15 healthy volunteers were included in this clinical trial. A total of 17 patients (H2 group) drank water three × 330 mL/day with tablets producing HRW (>4 mg/L H2) for 8 weeks, and 13 patients (P group) drank water with placebo tablets producing CO2. The concentration of CoQ10-TOTAL was determined by the HPLC method, the parameter of oxidative stress, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), by the spectrophotometric method, and mitochondrial bioenergetics in platelets isolated from whole blood by high-resolution respirometry. The patients with NAFLD had lower concentrations of CoQ10-TOTAL in the blood, plasma, and platelets vs. the control group. Mitochondrial CI-linked LEAK respiration was higher, and CI-linked oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and CII-linked electron transfer (ET) capacities were lower vs. the control group. Plasma TBARS concentrations were higher in the H2 group. After 8 weeks of adjuvant therapy with HRW, the concentration of CoQ10 in platelets increased, plasma TBARS decreased, and the efficiency of OXPHOS improved, while in the P group, the changes were non-significant. Long-term supplementation with HRW could be a promising strategy for the acceleration of health recovery in patients with NAFLD. The application of H2 appears to be a new treatment strategy for targeted therapy of mitochondrial disorders. Additional and longer-term studies are needed to confirm and elucidate the exact mechanisms of the mitochondria-targeted effects of H2 therapy in patients with NAFLD.

This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of hydrogen gas, known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, in attenuating inflammation specifically in the lungs and liver, and age-associated molecular markers in aged mice. Methods: Male mice aged 21 to 23 months, representative of the human elderly population, were subjected to inflammation via intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The mice were allocated into eight groups to examine the effects of varying durations and concentrations of hydrogen gas inhalation: control, saline without hydrogen, saline with 24-hour 2 % hydrogen, LPS without hydrogen, LPS with 24-hour 2 % hydrogen, LPS with 6-hour 2 % hydrogen, LPS with 1-hour 2 % hydrogen, and LPS with 24-hour 1 % hydrogen. Parameters assessed included survival rate, activity level, inflammatory biomarkers, and organ injury. Results: Extended administration of hydrogen gas specifically at a 2 % concentration for 24 h led to a favorable prognosis in the aged mice by reducing mRNA expression of inflammatory biomarkers in lung and liver tissue, mitigating lung injury, and diminishing the expression of the senescence-associated protein p21. Moreover, hydrogen gas inhalation selectively ameliorated senescence-related markers in lung tissue, including C-X-C motif chemokine 2, metalloproteinase-3, and arginase-1. Notably, hydrogen gas did not alleviate LPS-induced liver injury under the conditions tested. Conclusion: The study highlights that continuous inhalation of hydrogen gas at a 2 % concentration for 24 h can be a potent intervention in the geriatric population for improving survival and physical activity by mitigating pulmonary inflammation and modulating senescence-related markers in aged mice with LPS-induced inflammation. This finding paves the way for future research into hydrogen gas as a therapeutic strategy to alleviate severe inflammation that can lead to organ damage in the elderly.",Positive,Mouse,Lung,Aging,Inflammation,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,Japan

Metabolic syndrome is linked to the build-up of plaque within the artery, which leads to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems. A variety of treatments target the regulation of these conditions; nevertheless, they remain dominant risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which affect 26.9% of the US population. Management and intervention strategies for improving cholesterol and/or TG are worthwhile, and recent studies on hydrogen treatment are promising, particularly as molecular hydrogen is easily ingested. This study aimed to investigate the lipid-lowering effects and quality of life (QOL) improvement of hydrogen-rich coral calcium (HRCC) in patients with metabolic syndrome. Methods: The patients, all Taiwanese, were randomly assigned to 3 different doses (low, medium, and high) of HRCC capsules. The primary outcome was the adverse effects/symptoms during this 4-week use of HRCC capsules. The secondary outcome was lipid profile changes. Complete blood count, inflammatory biomarkers, and QOL were also measured before and after the course of HRCC. Results: Sixteen patients with metabolic syndrome completed this study (7 males, 9 females; mean age: 62 years; range: 32-80). No obvious adverse effects were recorded. Only changes in blood TG reached significance. The baseline TG value was 193.19 μL (SD = 107.44), which decreased to 151.75 μL (SD = 45.27) after 4 weeks of HRCC (p = 0.04). QOL showed no significant changes. Conclusion: This study is the first human clinical trial evaluating HRCC capsules in patients with metabolic syndrome. Based on the safety and potential TG-lowering effects of short-term HRCC, further long-term investigations of HRCC are warranted.

In recent years, a large number of studies have found that low-concentration hydrogen or hydrogen-rich water or hydrogen-saturated physiological saline has a protective effect on many diseases. Observing the intervention effect of hydrogen-rich water and speculate whether its effect is regulated by GP73/TGF-β signaling pathway would provide a basis for clinical treatment using hydrogen in liver cancer.Method The(N-nitrosodiethylamine) DEN-induced LX-2 hepatocyte injury model, hepatocarcinoma cell(HepG2 cells), and normal hepatic stellate cell LX-2 and HepG2 co-culture system were treated with hydrogen-rich water, and the cell viability was measured by the Cell Counting Kit-8(CCK-8)method. Also, the supernatant was collected to determination the transforming growth factor (TGF-β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and osteopontin (OPN) content. Subsequently, qPCR method was employed to detect the expression of GP73, TGF-β, and Smad2 mRNA in the cell. Total cell protein was extracted, and the level of GP73, TGF-β, and Smad2 proteins in the cells was detected by Western blot.ResultAfter the intervention of hydrogen-rich water, DEN increases the activity of LX-2 hepatocytes, inhibits the secretion of TGF-β, downregulate the expression of GP73, TGF-β, and Smad2 mRNA in the injured LX-2 cells, inhibits the expression of GP73 and TGF-β proteins, and exerts a protective effect on injured cells. The intervention with hydrogen-rich water in HepG2 liver cancer cells inhibits the expression of GP73 mRNA and protein in the cells, upregulates the expression of TGF-β mRNA and protein, inhibits the expression of OPN, and exerts an anti-proliferation effect on liver cancer cells. In the co-culture system of LX-2 and HepG2, the effect of hydrogen-rich water showed different effects with the altered ratio of the two cells in the system.Conclusion Hydrogen-rich water has a protective effect on liver cell damage and an inhibitory effect on liver cancer cells, which is effectuated by regulating the GP73/TGF-β signaling pathway.",Positive,Cell Culture,Liver,Cancer,Oncogenesis,Water (Dissolved),Neutral,Culture Media,,,China

Single anti-inflammation or anti-infection treatment exhibits limited survival benefit for severe cases. Here a biodegradable tobramycin-loaded magnesium micromotor (Mg-Tob motor) is successfully developed as a potential hydrogen generator and active antibiotic deliverer for synergistic therapy of sepsis. The peritoneal fluid of septic mouse provides an applicable space for Mg-water reaction.

Infarct volume and histological damage were evaluated by 2,3,5‑triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining (TTC staining). Golgi‑Cox staining was conducted to measure the morphological changes of neuronal dendrites and dendritic spines. The expression of neuronal markers was detected by immunofluorescence. Western blot was used to detect protein expression. The infarct volume of mice in the HRS‑H group decreased significantly compared to that of the distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) group. Mice in the HRS‑H group had a lower neurological deficit score than that in the dMCAO group. Compared to the dMCAO group, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the level of glutathione (GSH) significantly increased in the HRS‑H group. Compared with the dMCAO group, the number of apoptotic cells in the HRS‑H group decreased. Administration of HRS was shown to be able to decrease cavitation of the brain cortex after ischemia. The spine density in the HRS‑H group increased compared to that of the dMCAO group. In the in vitro experiment, compared with the oxygen‑glucose deprivation (OGD) group, the active oxygen content in the 75% HRM group decreased, and the mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content increased. Compared with the OGD group, the ratio of P‑AMPK and the levels of LC3II/LC3I in the hydrogen‑rich medium (HRM) group was upregulated, and P‑mTOR levels and P62 levels in the HRM group were down‑regulated. HRS can enhance neuroplasticity after ischemia and promote neurological recovery in mice with cerebral ischemia, which may involve the autophagy pathway mediated by the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.

This study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of HRW on ionizing radiation by coupling the brain metabolomics and biological target network methods. Methods and results: HRW significantly improves the cognitive impairment in rats exposed to ionizing radiation. Based on metabolomics and biological network results, we identified 54 differential metabolites and 93 target genes. The KEGG pathway indicates that glutathione metabolism, ascorbic acid and aldehyde acid metabolism, pentose and glucuronic acid interconversion, and glycerophospholipid metabolism play important roles in ionizing radiation therapy. Conclusion: Our study has systematically elucidated the molecular mechanism of HRW against ionizing radiation, which can be mediated by modulating targets, pathways and metabolite levels.

The lung is the most vulnerable target organ under septic conditions. Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) play a critical role in acute lung injury (ALI) caused by severe sepsis. The impairment of PMVECs during sepsis is a complex regulatory process involving multiple mechanisms, in which the imbalance of calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis of endothelial cells is a key factor in its functional impairment. Our preliminary results indicated that hydrogen gas (H2) treatment significantly alleviates lung injury in sepsis, protects PMVECs from hyperpermeability, and decreases the expression of plasma membrane stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), but the underlying mechanism by which H2 maintains Ca2+ homeostasis in endothelial cells in septic models remains unclear. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of STIM1 and Ca2+-release-activated- Ca2+ channel protein1 (Orai1) regulation by H2 treatment and explore the effect of H2 treatment on Ca2+ homeostasis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PMVECs and LPS-challenged mice. Methods: We observed the role of H2 on LPS-induced ALI of mice in vivo. The lung wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio, total protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and Evans blue dye (EBD) assay were used to evaluate the pulmonary endothelial barrier damage of LPS-challenged mice. The expression of STIM1 and Orai1 were also detected using epifluorescence microscopy. Moreover, we also investigated the role of H2- rich medium in regulating PMVECs under LPS treatment, which induced injury similar to sepsis in vitro. The expression of STIM1 and Orai1 as well as the Ca2+ concentration in PMVECs were examined. Results: In vivo, we found that H2 alleviated ALI of mice through decreasing lung W/D weight ratio, total protein in the BAL fluid and permeability of lung. In addition, H2 also decreased the expression of STIM1 and Orai1 in pulmonary microvascular endothelium. In vitro, LPS treatment increased the expression levels of STIM1 and Orai1 in PMVECs, while H2 reversed these changes. Furthermore, H2 ameliorated Ca2+ influx under sepsis-mimicking conditions. Treatment with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA) inhibitor, thapsigargin (TG), resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability as well as a reduction in the expression of junctional proteins, including VE-cadherin and occludin. Treatment with the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) inhibitor, YM-58483 (BTP2), increased the cell viability and expression of junctional proteins. Conclusions: The present study suggested that H2 treatment alleviates LPS-induced PMVEC dysfunction by inhibiting SOCE mediated by STIM1 and Orai1 in vitro and in vivo.",Positive,Cell Culture,Lung,Sepsis,Oxidative Stress,Medium (Dissolved),N/A,Culture Media,,,China

Oxidative stress increases during gestation, whereas hydrogen gas has antioxidant effects with therapeutic benefits. We have previously reported that the offspring from a pregnant, excessive folic acid mouse model (PEFAM) had abnormal glucose metabolism after growth. We hypothesized that IMDH by FOS feeding during gestation in PEFAM would suppress maternal and fetal oxidative stress. C57BL/6J mice on day 1 of gestation were divided into 3 groups and dissected at gestational day 18. The control (CONT) diet was AIN-93G containing folic acid 2 mg/kg diet; PEFAM was fed with an excessive folic acid (EFA) diet containing folic acid 40 mg/kg diet, and the EFA-FOS diet was replaced half of the sucrose in the EFA diet. Hydrogen gas concentrations in maternal livers and whole fetuses in EFA-FOS were significantly higher than those in CONT and EFA, respectively (P < .05). Maternal and fetal 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in EFA-FOS were not significantly different from those in the CONT group, whereas those in the EFA group were significantly increased compared with CONT and EFA-FOS (P < .05). In EFA-FOS, expression of protein and mRNA of superoxide dismutase and heme oxygenase 1 in mothers and superoxide dismutase in fetuses were not significantly different from those in CONT, whereas those in EFA were significantly increased (P < .05). The protein expression of Nrf2 in mothers and fetuses were not significantly different between EFA-FOS and CONT. Therefore, FOS feeding to PEFAM during gestation decreases maternal and fetal oxidative stress through IMDH.

Although several metabolic interventions have been devoted to ameliorate immunosuppression, intracellular residual LA still remains a potential energy source for oncocyte proliferation. Herein, we construct an immunomodulatory nanoadjuvant based on a yolk-shell CoP/NiCoP (CNCP) heterostructure loaded with the monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) inhibitor fluvastatin sodium (Flu) to concurrently relieve immunosuppression and elicit robust antitumor immunity. Under NIR irradiation, CNCP heterojunctions exhibit superior photothermal performance and photocatalytic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen. The continuous heat then facilitates Flu release to restrain LA exudation from tumor cells, whereas cumulative LA can be depleted as a hole scavenger to improve photocatalytic efficiency. Subsequently, potentiated photocatalytic therapy (PCT) can not only initiate systematic immunoreaction, but also provoke severe mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupt the energy supply for heat shock protein (HSP) synthesis, in turn realizing mild photothermal therapy (PTT). Consequently, LA metabolic remodeling endows an intensive cascade treatment with an optimal safety profile to effectually suppress tumor proliferation and metastasis, which offers a new paradigm for the development of metabolism-regulated immunotherapy.

Hydrogen (H2) is the lightest gas with multiple biological effects such as high selective anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis. However, the dose effects and innate immune mechanisms of intraperitoneal injection of H2 on ALD are limited. Here, we used acute ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity mice models to estimate the actions of intraperitoneal injection of H2 on ALD. The effects of H2 on acute ethanol-induced liver damage were examined by hepatic oil red O staining, quantitative PCR (qPCR) for lipid metabolic genes, hepatic triglyceride (TG) and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Hepatic mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) levels were examined to evaluate oxidative stress. Immunoblot, and immunofluorescence staining were used to further confirm the innate immune molecular targets of H2. Our results showed that intraperitoneal injection of H2 improved acute ethanol-induced liver injury in mice in a dose dependent manner, as indicated by decreasing serum ALT and AST levels, hepatic TG levels, and increasing lipid export genes (Mttp and Apob) mRNA levels and reducing fatty acid uptake gene (CD36) mRNA levels. Mechanistically, H2 inhibited hepatic oxidative stress as indicated by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), 3-NT, and MDA levels in the liver, while increasing hepatic GSH levels; inhibited the overactived TLR4/9-NF-κB-TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-18 innate immune signaling; suppressed the canonical Caspase-1-GSDMD pyroptosis signaling, and the non-canonical pyroptosis signaling, such as Caspase-11-GSDMD, Caspase-8-GSDMD and Caspase-3-GSDME signaling. Therefore, our study highlights that intraperitoneal injection of H2 may represent a novel therapeutic and safe strategy for ALD via modulating oxidative stress, innate immunity and pyroptosis.

Hydrogen has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; therefore, we hypothesized that hydrogen would alleviate endothelial glycocalyx damage caused by CPB. Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 7 per group), as follows: sham, control, 2% hydrogen, and 4% hydrogen. The rats were subjected to 90 minutes of partial CPB followed by 120 minutes of observation. In the hydrogen groups, hydrogen was administered via the ventilator and artificial lung during CPB, and via the ventilator for 60 minutes after CPB. After observation, blood collection, lung extraction, and perfusion fixation were performed, and the heart, lung, and brain endothelial glycocalyx thickness was measured by electron microscopy. The serum syndecan-1 concentration, a glycocalyx component, in the 4% hydrogen group (5.7 ± 4.4 pg/mL) was lower than in the control (19.5 ± 6.6 pg/mL) and 2% hydrogen (19.8 ± 5.0 pg/mL) groups (P < 0.001 for each), but it was not significantly different from the sham group (6.2 ± 4.0 pg/mL, P = 0.999).

The 4% hydrogen group had lower inflammatory cytokine concentrations (interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α) in serum and lung tissue, as well as a lower serum malondialdehyde concentration, than the control group. The 2% hydrogen group showed no significant difference in the serum syndecan-1 concentration compared with the control group. However, non-significant decreases in serum and lung tissue inflammatory cytokine concentrations, as well as in serum malondialdehyde concentration, were observed.

C57BL/6N mice were randomly allocated into four groups: control (Con), CIH, CIH + H2, and H2. The mice were exposed to CIH (21-5% FiO2, 3 min/cycle, 8 h/d), and received inhalation of a hydrogen-oxygen mixture (2 h/d) for 5 weeks. Cardiac and mitochondrial function, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and iron levels were evaluated. The H9C2 cell line was subjected to intermittent hypoxia (IH) and treated with H2. Firstly, we found H2 had a notable impact on cardiac hypertrophy, ameliorated pathological alterations and mitochondrial morphology induced by CIH (p < 0.05). Secondly, H2 exhibited a suppressive effect on oxidative injury by decreasing levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) (p < 0.05) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) (p < 0.01). Thirdly, H2 demonstrated a significant reduction in iron levels within myocardial cells through the upregulation of ferroportin 1 (FPN1) proteins (p < 0.01) and the downregulation of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), divalent metal transporter 1 with iron-responsive element (DMT1(+ire)), and ferritin light chain (FTL) mRNA or proteins (p < 0.05). Simultaneously, H2 exhibited the ability to decrease the levels of Fe2+ and ROS in H9C2 cells exposed to IH (p < 0.05). Moreover, H2 mediated the expression of hepcidin, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) (p < 0.01), and iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), which might be involved in the regulation of iron-related transporter proteins.

This symptomatology greatly weakens patients and may even lead to adjournment of chemotherapy. The protecting actions of molecular hydrogen in many neurological illnesses have been described, but its effect on the functional and emotional deficiencies caused by CIS has not been assessed. In C57BL/6J male and female mice injected with CIS, we examined the impact of the prophylactic treatment with hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on: (i) the tactile and cold allodynia, (ii) the deficits of grip strength and weight loss, (iii) the anxiodepressive-like behaviors and (iv) the inflammatory and oxidative reactions incited by CIS in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The results demonstrate that the mechanical allodynia and the anxiodepressive-like comportment provoked by CIS were similarly manifested in both sexes, whereas the cold allodynia, grip strength deficits and body weight loss produced by this chemotherapeutic agent were greater in female mice. Nonetheless, the prophylactic treatment with HRW prevented the allodynia and the functional and emotional impairments resulting from CIS in both sexes. This treatment also inhibited the inflammatory and oxidative responses activated by CIS in the DRG and PFC in both sexes, which might explain the therapeutic actions of HRW in male and female mice. In conclusion, this study revealed the plausible use of HRW as a new therapy for the allodynia and physical and mental impairments linked with CIS and its possible mechanism of action.

Oxidative stress is deeply involved in secondary brain injury, so molecular hydrogen therapy may be effective for TBI. Hydrogen gas shows the optimal effect at concentrations of 2% or higher, but can only be used up to 1.3% in the form of a gas cylinder mixed with oxygen gas, which may not be sufficiently effective. The partial pressure of hydrogen increases in proportion to the pressure, so hyperbaric hydrogen therapy (HBH2) is more effective than that at atmospheric pressure.

Hydrogen molecule (H2) has been proved to be a safe and effective anti-inflammatory agent, but conventional H2 administration methods cannot provide a high dosage and a long duration of H2 treatment in IR-related tissues and thus lead to limited therapeutic efficacies. We here propose a new strategy of controlled H2 release to match the time window of gastric emptying for maximizing the bioavailability and therapeutic outcome of H2. This work enhances the hydrolysis rate of Zn by constructing a Zn-Fe primary-battery micro-/nano-structure, and the H2-releasing rate is adjusted by tuning the ratio of Zn to Fe. The Zn-Fe micro-/nano-structure is orally administrated once daily to alleviate obesity-associated T2D in a leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mouse model. The H2 generation time of the Zn-Fe primary-battery micro-/nano-structure with the Fe/Zn ratio of 1:100 in gastric acid is about 3 h, just matching with the time window of gastric emptying in mice. In vivo monitoring results show that H2 generated by Zn-Fe micro-/nano-structure in stomach can effectively accumulate in major IR-sited tissues including liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle at a high dose for a relatively long time compared to H2-rich water drinking. Oral administration of Zn-Fe micro-/nano-structure at 200 mg/kg body weight has realized an efficient IR improvement and remarkably ameliorated systemic inflammation in ob/ob mice.

In this work, we find that local H2 supply can remodel the senescence microenvironment by anti-inflammation and anti-senescence effects in various senescent cells from skeletally mature bone. We construct a H2-releasing scaffold which can release high-dosage H2 (911 mL/g, up to 1 week) by electrospraying polyhydroxyalkanoate-encapsulated CaSi2 nanoparticles onto mesoporous bioactive glass. We demonstrate efficient remodeling of the microenvironment and enhanced repair of critical-size bone defects in an aged mouse model. Mechanistically, we reveal that local H2 release alters the microenvironment from pro-inflammation to anti-inflammation by senescent macrophages repolarization and secretome change. We also show that H2 alleviates the progression of aging/injury-superposed senescence, facilitates the recruitment of endogenous cells and the preservation of their regeneration capability, thereby creating a pro-regenerative microenvironment able to support bone defect regeneration.

Molecular hydrogen has recently gained popularity as a nontoxic ergogenic and health promoter. The effect of molecular hydrogen on sleep and sleep-related neural systems remains unexplored. This study investigates the impact of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on sleep behavior and neuronal activation in sleep-deprived mice. Methods: Adult C57BL/6J mice were implanted with electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recording electrodes and given HRW (0.7-1.4 mM) or regular water for 7 days ad libitum. Sleep-wake cycles were recorded under baseline conditions and after acute sleep loss. Neuronal activation in sleep- and wake-related regions was assessed using cFos immunostaining. Results: HRW increased sleep consolidation in undisturbed mice and increased non-rapid-eye movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep amount in sleep-deprived mice. HRW also decreased the average amount of time for mice to fall asleep after light onset. Neuronal activation in the lateral septum, medial septum, ventrolateral preoptic area, and median preoptic area was significantly altered in all mice treated with HRW. Conclusions: HRW improves sleep consolidation and increases neuronal activation in sleep-related brain regions. It may serve as a simple, effective treatment to improve recovery after sleep loss.

However, the effect on seizure burden was unclear. Using amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), we compared TH + H2 with TH alone in piglets 24 h after hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult. Methods: After a 40-min insult and resuscitation, 36 piglets ≤24 h old were divided into three groups: normothermia (NT, n = 14), TH alone (33.5 ± 0.5 °C, 24 h, n = 13), and TH + H2 (2.1-2.7% H2 gas, 24 h, n = 9). aEEG was recorded for 24 h post-insult and its background pattern, status epilepticus (SE; recurrent seizures lasting >5 min), and seizure occurrence (Sz; occurring at least once but not fitting the definition of SE) were evaluated. Background findings with a continuous low voltage and burst suppression were considered abnormal. Results: The percentage of piglets with an abnormal aEEG background (aEEG-BG), abnormal aEEG-BG+Sz and SE was lower with TH + H2 than with TH at 24 h after HI insult. The duration of SE was shorter with TH + H2 and significantly shorter than with NT. Conclusions: H2 gas combined with TH ameliorated seizure burden 24 h after HI insult. Impact: In this asphyxiated piglet model, there was a high percentage of animals with an abnormal amplitude-integrated electroencephalography background (aEEG-BG) after hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult, which may correspond to moderate and severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) was associated with a low percentage of piglets with EEG abnormalities up to 6 h after HI insult but this percentage increased greatly after 12 h, and TH was not effective in attenuating seizure development.

This research was carried out jointly by Susaki City; Nihon Trim Co., Ltd.; and Kochi University as part of a local revitalization project with health as a keyword. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial was conducted to evaluate the clinical impact of EHW on participants who suffered from metabolic syndrome or pre-metabolic syndrome. EHW was produced via electrolysis using a commercially available apparatus (Nihon Trim Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). During exercise, oxidative stress increases, and active oxygen species increase. In this study, we examined 181 subjects with metabolic syndrome or pre-metabolic syndrome. Among the group that drank EHW for 3 months, those who also engaged in a high level of physical activity showed a significant difference in waist circumference reduction. Although no significant difference was observed, several positive results were found in the participants who engaged in a high level of physical activity. Urinary 8-OHdG, urinary nitrotyrosine, HbA1c, and blood glucose levels increased in the filtered water (FW) group but decreased in the EHW group.

Hydrogen gas has anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties and has been shown to be safe in humans. The study aimed to investigate whether hydrogen gas protects against skeletal muscle I/R injury. Methods: Experimental basic research using mice. A total of 160 eight to 10 week old albino laboratory bred strain of house mice (25.8 ± 0.68 g) were used in this study. The mice were cable tied to the hindlimb under anaesthesia and then placed in an anaesthesia box filled with air and 2% isoflurane (control group); 80 mice were additionally subjected to 1.3% hydrogen gas in this mix (hydrogen group). After 2 hours, cable ties on the mice were removed to initiate reperfusion, and hydrogen inhalation lasted for 6 hours in the hydrogen group.

Therefore, developing therapeutic agents that can prevent IR injury at early stages and suppress its progression is imperative. As IR injury may be closely related to oxidative stress, antioxidants can be effective therapeutic agents. Our silicon (Si)-based agent, an antioxidant, generated a large amount of hydrogen in the intestinal tract for a prolonged period after oral administration. As it has been effective for ulcerative colitis, renal failure, and IR injury during skin flap transplantation, it could be effective for small intestinal IR injury. Herein, we investigated the efficacy of an Si-based agent in a mouse model of small intestinal IR injury. The Si-based agent suppressed the apoptosis of small intestinal epithelial cells by reducing the oxidative stress induced by IR injury. In addition, the thickness of the mucosal layer in the small intestine of the Si-based agent-administered group was significantly higher than that in the untreated group, revealing that Si-based agent is effective against small intestinal IR injuries. In the future, Si-based agents may improve the success rate of small intestine transplantation.

This release of hydrogen has been associated with a range of biological effects, including anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidant activity, and protection of the intestinal barrier. Previous research has shown that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a role in the dysfunction of the intestinal barrier in conditions such as sepsis and critical illnesses. However, it remains unclear as to whether MgH2 can protect the intestinal barrier by inhibiting NET formation, and the underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. A rat model of hemorrhagic shock was created, and pretreatment or posttreatment procedures with MgH2 were performed. After 24 h, samples from the small intestine and blood were collected for analysis. In vitro, human neutrophils were incubated with either phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or MgH2. Reactive oxygen species generation and the expression of key proteins were assessed. The results demonstrated that MgH2 administration led to a decrease in inflammatory cytokines in the serum and mitigated distant organ dysfunction in rats with HS. Furthermore, MgH2 treatment reversed histopathological damage in the intestines, improved intestinal permeability, and enhanced the expression of tight junction proteins (TJPs) during HS. Additionally, MgH2 treatment was found to suppress NET formation in the intestines. In vitro pretreatment with MgH2 alleviated intestinal monolayer barrier disruption that was induced by NETs. Mechanistically, MgH2 pretreatment reduced ROS production and NET formation, inhibited the activation of ERK and p38, and suppressed the expression of the PAD4 protein. These findings indicated that MgH2 may inhibit NET formation in a ROS/MAPK/PAD4-dependent manner, which reduces NET-related intestinal barrier damage, thus offering a novel protective role in preventing intestinal barrier dysfunction during HS.

We have found that molecular hydrogen (H2) inhalation improved the survival rate and cardiac injury in septic mice. However, the mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the regulatory mechanism by which hydrogen modulates autophagy and its role in hydrogen protection of SIC. Methods: Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to induce sepsis in adult C57BL/6J male mice. The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: Sham, Sham + 2% hydrogen inhalation (H2), CLP, and CLP + H2 group. The 7-day survival rate was recorded. Myocardial pathological scores were calculated. Myocardial troponin I (cTnI) levels in serum were detected, and the levels of autophagy- and mitophagy-related proteins in myocardial tissue were measured. Another four groups of mice were also studied: CLP, CLP + Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), CLP + H2, and CLP + H2 + BafA1 group. Mice in the BafA1 group received an intraperitoneal injection of the autophagy inhibitor BafA1 1 mg/kg 1 h after operation. The detection indicators remained the same as before. Results: The survival rate of septic mice treated with H2 was significantly improved, myocardial tissue inflammation was improved, serum cTnI level was decreased, autophagy flux was increased, and mitophagy protein content was decreased (P < 0.05). Compared to the CLP + H2 group, the CLP + H2 + BafA1 group showed a decrease in autophagy level and 7-day survival rate, an increase in myocardial tissue injury and cTnI level, which reversed the protective effect of hydrogen (P < 0.05).

The pattern of output signals, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy fluctuations (i.e., fNIRS), is thus complex. We demonstrate first-of-its-kind evidence that this fNIRS complexity is a marker that captures the influence of endurance capacity and the effects of hydrogen gas (H2) on PFC regulation. Aim: We aim to explore the effects of different physical loads of exercise as well as the intaking of hydrogen gas on the fNIRS complexity of the PFC. Approach: Twenty-four healthy young men completed endurance cycling exercise from 0 (i.e., baseline) to 100% of their physical loads after intaking 20 min of either H2 or placebo gas (i.e., control) on each of two separate visits. The fNIRS measuring the PFC hemodynamics and heart rate (HR) was continuously recorded throughout the exercise. The fNIRS complexity was quantified using multiscale entropy. Results: The fNIRS complexity was significantly greater in the conditions from 25% to 100% of the physical load (p<0.0005) compared with the baseline and after intaking H2 before exercise; this increase of fNIRS complexity was significantly greater compared with the control (p=0.001∼0.01). At the baseline, participants with a greater fNIRS complexity had a lower HR (β=−0.35∼−0.33, p=0.008∼0.02). Those with a greater increase of complexity had a lower increase of the HR (β=−0.30∼−0.28, p=0.001∼0.002) during exercise. Conclusions: These observations suggest that fNIRS complexity would be a marker that captures the adaptive capacity of PFC to endurance exercise and to the effects of interventions on PFC hemodynamics.

The strategy of including small fractions of nitrogen in the respired gas to produce an anti-HPNS narcotic effect increases the gas density which may exceed recommended guidelines. In 2020 the 'Wetmules' dive team explored the Pearse Resurgence cave (New Zealand) to 245 m breathing trimix (approximately 4% oxygen, 91% helium and 5% nitrogen). Despite the presence of nitrogen, one diver experienced HPNS tremors beyond 200 m. The use of hydrogen (a light yet slightly narcotic gas) has been suggested as a solution to this problem but there are concerns, including the potential for ignition and explosion of hydrogen-containing gases, and accelerated heat loss. In February 2023 a single dive to 230 m was conducted in the Pearse Resurgence to experience hydrogen as a breathing gas in a deep bounce dive. Using an electronic closed-circuit rebreather, helihydrox (approximately 3% oxygen, 59% helium and 38% hydrogen) was breathed between 200 and 230 m. This was associated with amelioration of HPNS symptoms in the vulnerable diver and no obvious adverse effects. The use of hydrogen is a potential means of progressing deeper with effective HPNS amelioration while maintaining respired gas density within advised guidelines.

Methods: In Experiment 1, rabbits were randomly assigned to a 1.2% H2 gas group, HS group, 1.2% H2 gas + HS group (combination group), or control group (n = 6 per group). The H2 concentration of HS was 0.65 mM. H2 was inhaled for 60 min, starting 5 min before reperfusion. HS (20 mL/kg) was divided into six bolus injections at 10-min intervals, starting 5 min before reperfusion. Spinal cord ischemia was produced by occluding the abdominal aorta for 15 min. Neurologic and histopathologic evaluations were performed 7 days after reperfusion. In Experiment 2, H2 concentrations in spinal cord tissue according to the administration of 1.2% H2 gas or HS were compared by measuring the electric current through a platinum needle electrode (n = 2). In Experiment 3, rabbits were assigned to a 2% H2 gas group or control group (n = 6 per group). Spinal cord ischemia was produced and neurologic and histopathologic evaluations were performed as in Experiment 1. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in the neurologic and histopathologic outcomes in Experiments 1 and 3.

Evidence has emerged of the beneficial effect of hydrogen in acute lung injury (ALI), but the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this research, the recovery action of hydrogen on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice and A549 cells was investigated. The 7-day survival rate and body weight of mice were measured after intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Lung function was determined by a whole body plethysmography (WBP) system using the indicators respiratory rate and enhanced pause. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining confirmed the signs of pulmonary edema and inflammatory ooze. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) quantification was used to detect the expression of inflammatory factors. Western blotting analysis evaluated the expression levels of involved proteins in the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. The experimental results confirmed that hydrogen provided an essential solution to the dissipative effects of LPS on survival rate, weight loss and lung function. The LPS-stimulated inflammatory factors, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were also suppressed by hydrogen in A549 cells. Western blot analysis showed that hydrogen significantly upregulated the levels of phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) and lowered the LPS-induced increased expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and Caspase3. These findings prove that hydrogen attenuated LPS-treated ALI by activating the AMPK pathway, supporting the feasibility of hydrogen treatment for sepsis.

However, this process can be delayed by oxidative stress and excessive inflammatory responses. In this study, we established a human inflammatory gingival tissue equivalent (iGTE) to investigate the inhibitory effects of hydrogen-rich water (HW), enzyme-digested edible bird's nest (EBND) and sialic acid (SA) on PMA (an inducer of oxidative free radicals)- and LPS (an inflammatory stimulus)-impaired wound healing. The iGTE was constructed by human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs), keratinocytes and macrophages under three-dimensional conditions. Wounds in the iGTE and hGF/keratinocyte monolayers were created by mechanical injury. Tissues and cells were pretreated with HW, EBND, and SA, and then exposed to the inflammatory and oxidative environment induced by PMA (10 ng/mL) and LPS (250 ng/mL). The inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 were quantitatively analyzed by ELISA. Histopathological image analysis was performed by HE and immunofluorescence staining. In the iGTE, PMA/LPS significantly reduced the epithelial thickness while causing a decrease in K8/18, E-cadherin, laminin and elastin expression and an increase in COX-2 expression along with ulcer-like lesions. In mechanically scratched hGFs and keratinocyte monolayers, PMA/LPS significantly impaired wound healing, and promoted the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8. Pretreatment of HW, EBND, and SA significantly suppressed PMA/LPS-induced wound healing delay and inflammatory responses in cell monolayers, as well as in the iGTE. Remarkably, the combined use of HW and EBND exhibited particularly robust results. Combined use of HW and EBND may be applied for the prevention and treatment of wound healing delay.

Methods The rd1 mice were divided randomly into control and H2 intervention groups. Mice from other groups received H2 intervention in three modes, two modes of the hydrogen gas (HG) and one model of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS). At 14 days post born (P14) and P21, various indicators were detected in all mice, including eletroretinogram (ERG), fundus phography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and retinal immunotaining of microglia cells' marker, Iba1. Results The ERG amplitude in mice from the control and H2 intervention groups showed no statistical differences (p > 0.05). At P14 and P21, no significant difference in the distance from the retinal pigment epithelium to the outer plexiform layer on OCT from mice of the above two groups was found (p > 0.05).

Hydrogen-rich saline (HRS), one of the hydrogen therapies, has been demonstrated to be effective in eye photodamage, but the effect on the expression of melanopsin in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) is unknown. In this study, we used a rat model of light-induced retinal injury to observe the expression of melanopsin after HRS treatment and to determine the effect of HRS on retinal ganglion cell protection. Adult SD rats were exposed to blue light (48 h) and treated with HRS for 0, 3, 7, and 14 days. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting (WB) were performed to find the expression of genes and proteins, respectively. The function of retinal ipRGCs was measured by pattern-evoked electroretinography (pERG). The number and morphological changes of melanopsin-positive ganglion cells in the retina were observed by immunofluorescence (IF). Acute blue light exposure caused a decrease in ipRGC function, decreased expression of melanopsin protein and the melanopsin-positive RGCs, and diminished immunoreactivity in dendrites. However, over time, melanopsin showed a tendency to self-recovery, with an increase in melanopsin protein expression and the number of melanopsin-positive RGCs, with incomplete recovery of function within two weeks. HRS treatment accelerated the recovery process, with a significant increase in melanopsin expression and the number of melanopsin-positive RGCs, and an improvement in the pERG waveform within two weeks.

Methods: Status epilepticus was induced using pilocarpine. The effects of hydrogen treatment on epilepsy severity in model rats were then monitored using Racine scores and electroencephalography (EEG), followed by western blot of plasma membrane N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B) and phosphorylated NR2B expression. We also generated a cellular epilepsy model using Mg2+-free medium and used polymerase chain reaction to investigate the neuroprotective effects of hydrogen. Results: There were no significant differences in Racine scores between the hydrogen and control groups. EEG amplitudes were lower in the hydrogen treatment group than in the control group. In epilepsy model rats, hippocampal cell membrane NR2B expression and phosphorylation increased gradually over time. Although hippocampal cell membrane NR2B expression was not significantly different between the two groups, NR2B phosphorylation levels were significantly lower in the hydrogen group. Hydrogen treatment also increased superoxide dismutase, mitochondrial (SOD2) expression.

The disruption of the lung epithelial barrier plays a crucial role in ARDS pathogenesis. Recent studies have proposed the involvement of abnormal mitochondrial dynamics mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in the mechanism of impaired epithelial barrier in ARDS. Hydrogen is an anti-oxidative stress molecule that regulates mitochondrial function via multiple signaling pathways. Our previous study confirmed that hydrogen modulated oxidative stress and attenuated acute pulmonary edema in ARDS by upregulating thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) expression, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hydrogen on mitochondrial dynamics both in vivo and in vitro. Our study revealed that hydrogen inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced phosphorylation of Drp1 (at Ser616), suppressed Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission, alleviated epithelial tight junction damage and cell apoptosis, and improved the integrity of the epithelial barrier. This process was associated with the upregulation of Trx1 in lung epithelial tissues of ARDS mice by hydrogen. In addition, hydrogen treatment reduced the production of reactive oxygen species in LPS-induced airway epithelial cells (AECs) and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that the mitochondrial dysfunction was restored. Then, the expression of tight junction proteins occludin and zonula occludens 1 was upregulated, and apoptosis in AECs was alleviated. Remarkably, the protective effects of hydrogen on the mitochondrial and epithelial barrier were eliminated after applying the Trx1 inhibitor PX-12. The results showed that hydrogen significantly inhibited the cell apoptosis and the disruption of epithelial tight junctions, maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier in mice of ARDS. This might be related to the inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission through the Trx1 pathway. The findings of this study provided a new theoretical basis for the application of hydrogen in the clinical treatment of ARDS.

The ARP model was induced by X-ray irradiation. Histopathological changes were assessed using HE and Masson stains. Inflammatory cytokines were detected by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were performed to quantify macrophage (CD68) levels and the M2/M1 ratio. Western blot analysis, RT-qPCR, ELISA and flow cytometry were used to evaluate mitochondrial oxidative stress injury indicators. Immunofluorescence double staining was performed to colocalize CD68/LC3B and p-AMPK-α/CD68. The relative expression of proteins associated with autophagy activation and the adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin/Unc-51-like kinase 1 (AMPK/mTOR/ULK1) signaling pathway were detected by western blotting. ARP decreased body weight, increased the lung coefficient, collagen deposition and macrophage infiltration and promoted M1 polarization in rats. After HRS treatment, pathological damage was alleviated, and M1 polarization was inhibited. Furthermore, HRS treatment reversed the ARP-induced high levels of mitochondrial oxidative stress injury and autophagy inhibition. Importantly, the phosphorylation of AMPK-α was inhibited, the phosphorylation of mTOR and ULK1 was activated in ARP rats and this effect was reversed by HRS treatment.

Hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) solution exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to examine the effects of HRS applied before ischemia in the lungs of rats using a lower extremity IR model. Material and methods: After approval was obtained from the ethics committee, 18 male Wistar albino rats weighing 250-280 g were randomly divided into three groups: control (C), IR and IR-HRS. In the IR and IR-HRS groups, an atraumatic microvascular clamp was used to clamp the infrarenal abdominal aorta, and skeletal muscle ischemia was induced. After 120 min, the clamp was removed, and reperfusion was achieved for 120 min. In the IR-HRS group, HRS was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before the procedure. Lung tissue samples were examined under a light microscope and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E). Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, total sulfhydryl (SH) levels, and histopathological parameters were evaluated in the tissue samples. Results: MDA and total SH levels were significantly higher in the IR group than in the control group (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.001, respectively). MDA and total SH levels were significantly lower in the IR-HRS group than in the IR group (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.013, respectively). A histopathological examination revealed that neutrophil infiltration/aggregation, alveolar wall thickness, and total lung injury score were significantly higher in the IR group than in the control group (p < 0.0001, p = 0.001, and p < 0.0001, respectively). Similarly, alveolar wall thickness and total lung injury scores were significantly higher in the IR-HRS group than in the control group (p = 0.009 and p = 0.004, respectively). A statistically significant decrease was observed in neutrophil infiltration/aggregation and total lung injury scores in the IR-HRS group compared to those in the IR group (p = 0.023 and p = 0.022, respectively). Conclusion: HRS at a dose of 20 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally 30 min before ischemia in rats, reduced lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, while also reducing IR damage in lung histopathology.

Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are important factors contributing to cognitive dysfunction in patients with VaD. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of hydrogen are increasingly being utilizied in neurological disorders, but conventional hydrogen delivery has the disadvantage of inefficiency. Therefore, we used magnesium silicide nanosheets (MSNs) to release hydrogen in vivo in larger quantities and for longer periods of time to explore the appropriate dosage and regimen. In this study, we observed that hydrogen improved learning and working memory in VaD rats in the Morris water maze and Y-maze, which elicited improved cognitive function.

Among TME components, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) show multiple tumor-promoting effects and can induce tumor immune evasion and drug-resistance. Regulating CAFs can be a potential strategy to augment systemic anti-tumor immunity. Here, the study observes that hydrogen treatment can alleviate intracellular reactive oxygen species of CAFs and reshape CAFs' tumor-promoting and immune-suppressive phenotypes. Accordingly, a controllable and TME-responsive hydrogen therapy based on a CaCO3 nanoparticles-coated magnesium system (Mg-CaCO3) is developed. The hydrogen therapy by Mg-CaCO3 can not only directly kill tumor cells, but also inhibit pro-tumor and immune suppressive factors in CAFs, and thus augment immune activities of CD4+ T cells. As implanted in situ, Mg-CaCO3 can significantly suppress tumor growth, turn the ""cold"" primary tumor into ""hot"", and stimulate systematic anti-tumor immunity, which is confirmed by the bilateral tumor transplantation models of ""cold tumor"" (4T1 cells) and ""hot tumor"" (MC38 cells).

Results: After treatment, the overall effect of the hydrogen inhalation group (90.00%) was significantly better than that of the conventional group (72.00%), which was statistically significant (P = .022). In terms of specific biomarkers, post-treatment levels of E-cadherin were elevated to 0.84±0.05 ng/mL in the hydrogen group compared to 0.72±0.06 ng/mL in the routine group.

However, with hydrogen inhalation, the concentration that can be reached within target organs is low and the duration of action is short, which makes it difficult to achieve high dose targeted delivery of hydrogen to the heart, seriously limiting the therapeutic potential of hydrogen for MI. As a result of reactions with the internal environment of the body, subcutaneous implantation of magnesium slices leads to continuous endogenous hydrogen production, leading to a higher hydrogen concentration and a longer duration of action in target organs. In this study, we propose magnesium implant-based hydrogen therapy for MI. After subcutaneous implantation of magnesium slices in the dorsum of rats, we measured hydrogen production and efficiency, and evaluated the safety of this approach. Compared with hydrogen inhalation, it significantly improved cardiac function in rats with MI. Magnesium implantation also cleared free radicals that were released as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as suppressing cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has been widely considered among adverse pregnancy outcomes, without effective treatment. Placenta plays a role in defense, synthesis, and immunity, which provides a new perspective for the treatment of BPD. This study aimed to investigate if H2 reduced the placental inflammation to protect the neonatal rat against BPD damage and potential mechanisms. Methods: We induced neonatal BPD model by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 µg) into the amniotic fluid at embryonic day 16.5 as LPS group. LPS + H2 group inhaled 42% H2 gas (4 h/day) until the samples were collected. We primarily analyzed the neonatal outcomes and then compared inflammatory levels from the control group (CON), LPS group and LPS + H2 group. HE staining was performed to evaluate inflammatory levels. RNA sequencing revealed dominant differentially expressed genes. Bioinformatics analysis (GO and KEGG) of RNA-seq was applied to mine the signaling pathways involved in protective effect of H2 on the development of LPS-induced BPD. We further used qRT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA methods to verify differential expression of mRNA and proteins. Moreover, we verified the correlation between the upstream signaling pathways and the downstream targets in LPS-induced BPD model. Results: Upon administration of H2, the inflammatory infiltration degree of the LPS-induced placenta was reduced, and infiltration significantly narrowed. Hydrogen normalized LPS-induced perturbed lung development and reduced the death ratio of the fetus and neonate. RNA-seq results revealed the importance of inflammatory response biological processes and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway in protective effect of hydrogen on BPD. The over-activated upstream signals [Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-κB p65), Caspase1 (Casp1) and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome] in LPS placenta were attenuated by H2 inhalation. The downstream targets, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, IL-1β, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1)], were decreased both in mRNA and protein levels by H2 inhalation in LPS-induced placentas to rescue them from BPD. Correlation analysis displayed a positive association of TLR4-mediated signaling pathway both proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in placenta. Conclusion: H2 inhalation ameliorates LPS-induced BPD by inhibiting excessive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the TLR4-NFκB-IL6/NLRP3 signaling pathway in placenta and may be a potential therapeutic strategy for BPD.",Positive,Rat,Lung,Pregnancy,Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,China

Lung function tests were performed to detect changes in lung function.HE staining was used to detect pathological changes in lung tissue. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the polarization of macrophages in lung tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect changes in cytokine expression in lung tissues. Western Blot was used to detect the expression of proteins related to the NF-κB signalling pathway. Results: Lung function test results showed that lung function decreased in the model group and improved in the treatment group.HE staining showed that inflammatory response was evident in the model group and decreased in the treatment group. Immunohistochemistry results showed that the expression of pro-inflammatory factors was significantly higher in the model group, and the expression of pro-inflammatory factors was significantly higher in the treatment group. The expression of pro-inflammatory factors in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the model group, and the expression of anti-inflammatory factors in the treatment group was higher than that in the model group.

Hydrogen (H2) has demonstrated antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties, yet its efficacy in treating silicosis remains unexplored. In this study, rats exposed to silica were administered interventions of H2 combined with tetrandrine, and euthanized at 14, 28, and 56 days post-intervention. Lung tissues and serum samples were collected for analysis. Histological examination, MDA assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, hydroxyproline assay, and Western blotting were employed to assess the impact of H2 combined with tetrandrine on pulmonary fibrosis. The results revealed that this combination significantly alleviated inflammation in silicosis-afflicted rats, effectively suppressed levels of MDA, TNF-α, and IL-1β expression, and inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby ameliorating pulmonary fibrosis. Notably, protein expression level of E-cadherin was increased，however protein expression levels of vimentin and α-SMA were reduced, and TGF-β were reduced, alongside a significant decrease in hydroxyproline content. Furthermore, H2 combined with tetrandrine downregulated protein expression of NF-κB p65, NF-κB p-p65, Caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3. These findings substantiate the hypothesis that H2 combined with tetrandrine mitigates inflammation associated with silicosis and suppresses the EMT process to ameliorate fibrosis via the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway. However, the pressure of airway opening was not assessed in this study and dynamic readings of lung physiological function were not obtained, which is a major limitation of this study.

Mice were treated with H2O2 for two weeks and either left untreated or supplied with HAW. The results show that HAW induced a reduction in the ROS plasmatic levels that was consistent with the increase in the circulating glutathione. At the same time, the reduction in plasmatic 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine was associated with reduced DNA damage in the whole body.

However, effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NAFLD are still scarce. Although hydrogen-rich water shows beneficial effects for hepatic steatosis, the inconvenience limits the application of this antioxidant. In light of this, hydrogen-rich coral calcium (HRCC) was developed due to its convenience and quantifiable characteristics. However, the effects of HRCC on NAFLD are still unknown. In the present study, we found that HRCC treatment improved methionine-and-choline-deficient diet (MCD)-induced hepatic steatosis, increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, and elevated hepatic inflammatory factor expressions in mice. In addition to the increased expressions of antioxidative enzymes, we found that HRCC increased the expressions of bile acid biosynthesis-related genes, including Cyp8b1 and Cyp27a1. Increased hepatic bile acid contents, such as muricholic acids, 23 nor-deoxycholic acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, and cholic acids, were also confirmed in MCD mice treated with HRCC. Since the biogenesis of bile acids is associated with the constitution of gut microbiome, the alterations in gut microbiome by HRCC were evaluated. We found that HRCC significantly changed the constitution of gut microbiome in MCD mice and increased the contents of Anaerobacterium, Acutalibacter, Anaerosacchariphilus, and Corynebacterium. Taken together, HRCC improved MCD-induced NAFLD through anti-inflammatory mechanisms and by increasing antioxidative activities. Additionally, HRCC might alter gut microbiome to change hepatic bile acid contents, exerting beneficial effects for the treatment of NAFLD.

The PIL can flocculate Chlorella through electrostatic interactions between PIL and Chlorella to form Chlorella agglomerates, endowing the Chlorella in the central agglomerates with the ability to continuously produce H2 for 24 h under mild conditions. Combining the membrane disruption-related bactericidal mechanism of PIL and the antioxidant properties of the produced H2, HAP-Chl was determined to be antibacterial and antioxidant. In addition to exhibiting biocompatible and nontoxic activities, subsequent Staphylococcus aureus-infected chronic wound studies revealed that HAP-Chl is capable of promoting the healing of chronic wounds by effectively killing bacteria, reducing extensive ROS, relieving inflammation, and promoting the deposition of mature collagen and angiogenesis.

Design: A parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind experimental design, maintaining a 1:1 allocation ratio between the experimental group (receiving the dihydrogen-producing minerals and PQQ) and the control group (receiving the placebo) throughout the trial. Setting and participants: Thirty-four elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (mean age 71.9 ± 3.8 years; 28 females) voluntarily provided written consent to participate in this trial. Participants were assigned in a double-blind parallel-group design to receive either a dihydrogen-PQQ mixture (Alpha Hope®, CalerieLife, Irvine, CA) or placebo twice daily for a 6-week intervention period. Methods: The primary endpoint was the change in serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from baseline to the 6-week follow-up; secondary outcomes included cognitive function indices, specific metabolites in brain tissue, brain oxygenation, and the prevalence and severity of side effects. Interaction effects (time vs. intervention) were evaluated using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Friedman's 2-way ANOVA by ranks, for normally distributed data with homogeneous variances and non-homogeneous variances, respectively. Results: Dihydrogen-PQQ resulted in a significant elevation in serum BDNF levels at the six-week follow-up (P = 0.01); conversely, no changes in BDNF levels were observed in the placebo group throughout the study duration (P = 0.27). A non-significant trend in the impact of interventions on BDNF levels was observed (treatment vs. time interaction, P = 0.14), suggesting a tendency for dihydrogen-PQQ to upregulate BDNF levels compared to the placebo.

These ions are instrumental in macrophage phenotype modulation, inflammation reduction, and angiogenesis promotion, all vital for diabetic bone healing. Additionally, hydrogen (H2) released during degradation mitigates oxidative stress by diminishing reactive oxygen species (ROS). This multifaceted approach not only reduces ROS and inflammation but also enhances M2 macrophage polarization and cell migration, culminating in improved angiogenesis and bone repair.

Nowadays anti-VEGF and retinal photocoagulation are mainstream treatments for ROP, but they develop a variety of complications. Hydrogen (H2) is widely considered as a useful neuroprotective and antioxidative therapeutic method for hypoxic-ischemic disease without toxic effects. However, whether H2 provides physiological angiogenesis promotion, neovascularization suppression and glial protection in the progression of ROP is largely unknown.This study aims to investigate the effects of H2 on retinal angiogenesis, neovascularization and neuroglial dysfunction in the retinas of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice. Methods: In this study, mice that were seven days old and either wild-type (WT) or Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) were exposed to 75% oxygen for 5 days and then returned to normal air conditions. Different stages of hydrogen gas (H2) inhalation were administered. Vascular obliteration, neovascularization, and blood vessel leakage were analyzed and compared. To count the number of neovascularization endothelial nuclei, routine HE staining of retinal sections was conducted. Immunohistochemistry was performed using DyLight 594 labeled GSL I-isolectin B4 (IB4), as well as primary antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and Iba-1. Western blots were used to measure the expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Notch1, Dll4, and HIF-1α. Additionally, the expression of target genes such as NQO1, HO-1, Notch1, Hey1, Hey2, and Dll4 was measured. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with H2 under hypoxia were used as an in vitro model. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the mRNA expression of Nrf2, Notch/Dll4, and the target genes. The expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed using immunofluorescence staining. Results: Our results indicate that 3-4% H2 does not disturb retinal physiological angiogenesis, but ameliorates vaso-obliteration and neovascularization in OIR mice. Moreover, H2 prevents the decreased density and reverses the morphologic and functional changes in retinal astrocytes caused by oxygen-induced injury. In addition, H2 inhalation reduces microglial activation, especially in the area of neovascularization in OIR mice. H2 plays a protective role in vascular regeneration by promoting Nrf2 activation and suppressing the Dll4-induced Notch signaling pathway in vivo.

In this study, we focused on hydrogen, known for its antioxidant potential, and explored the function of H2-filled UFBs, which encapsulate hydrogen, to determine their potential use as oral carriers for the delivery bioactive gases to living organisms. To this end, rats were orally administered ethanol to induce hepatic oxidative stress, and the effects of drinking H2-filled UFBs (H2 NanoGAS®) water for two weeks were evaluated to assess the reduction of oxidative stress. Continuous alcohol consumption was found to significantly increase the blood lipid peroxidation levels in the control group, confirming the induction of oxidative stress. An increase in blood lipid peroxidation was significantly inhibited by the consumption of concentrated H2 NanoGAS® (C-HN) water. Furthermore, the measurement of mitochondrial activity in the liver revealed that drinking H2 NanoGAS® water helped to maintain at a normal level and/or boosted the functional activity of the electron transport system in mitochondria affected by ethanol intake. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide evidence for the use of orally ingested UFBs as carriers for the delivery gases to tissues, thereby exerting their physiological activity in the body. Our findings highlight the potential for the application of UFBs to various physiologically active gases and their utilization in the medical field in the future.

To understand the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of H2 on the brain, we investigated the molecular signals affected by H2 in sevoflurane-induced neuronal cell death. We confirmed that neural progenitor cells are susceptible to sevoflurane and undergo apoptosis in the retrosplenial cortex of neonatal mice. Co-administration of 1-8% H2 gas for 3 h to sevoflurane-exposed pups suppressed elevated caspase-3-mediated apoptotic cell death and concomitantly decreased c-Jun phosphorylation and activation of the c-Jun pathway, all of which are induced by oxidative stress. Anesthesia-induced increases in lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were alleviated by H2 inhalation. Phosphoproteome analysis revealed enriched clusters of differentially phosphorylated proteins in the sevoflurane-exposed neonatal brain that included proteins involved in neuronal development and synaptic signaling. H2 inhalation modified cellular transport pathways that depend on hyperphosphorylated proteins including microtubule-associated protein family.

Therefore, identifying efficient therapeutic modalities for constipation is of paramount importance. Oxidative stress is a pivotal contributor to colonic dysmotility and is the underlying pathology responsible for constipation symptoms. Consequently, we postulate that hydrogen therapy, an emerging and promising intervention, can serve as a safe and efficacious treatment for constipation. Aim: To determine whether hydrogen-rich water (HRW) alleviates constipation and its potential mechanism. Methods: Constipation models were established by orally loperamide to Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats freely consumed HRW, and were recorded their 24 h total stool weight, fecal water content, and charcoal propulsion rate. Fecal samples were subjected to 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Serum non-targeted metabolomic analysis, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase levels were determined. Colonic tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff, reactive oxygen species (ROS) immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry for cell growth factor receptor kit (c-kit), PGP 9.5, sirtuin1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis were conducted to determine the expression level of SIRT1, Nrf2 and HO-1. A rescue experiment was conducted by intraperitoneally injecting the SIRT1 inhibitor, EX527, into constipated rats. NCM460 cells were induced with H2O2 and treated with the metabolites to evaluate ROS and SIRT1 expression. Results: HRW alleviated constipation symptoms by improving the total amount of stool over 24 h, fecal water content, charcoal propulsion rate, thickness of the intestinal mucus layer, c-kit expression, and the number of intestinal neurons. HRW modulated intestinal microbiota imbalance and abnormalities in serum metabolism. HRW could also reduce intestinal oxidative stress through the SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. This regulatory effect on oxidative stress was confirmed via an intraperitoneal injection of a SIRT1 inhibitor to constipated rats. The serum metabolites, β-leucine (β-Leu) and traumatic acid, were also found to attenuate H2O2-induced oxidative stress in NCM460 cells by up-regulating SIRT1. Conclusion: HRW attenuates constipation-associated intestinal oxidative stress via SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, modulating gut microbiota and serum metabolites. β-Leu and traumatic acid are potential metabolites that upregulate SIRT1 expression and reduce oxidative stress.",Positive,Rat,Intestine,Constipation,Oxidative Stress,Water (Electrolysis),Neutral,Ingestion,,,China

The importance of microcirculatory dysfunction in sepsis is becoming increasingly evident, in which endothelial dysfunction and glycocalyx degradation play a major role. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) on renal microcirculation in septic renal failure, and whether Sirt1 was involved in the renoprotective effects of HRS. Rats model of sepsis was established by cecal ligation and puncture, and septic rats were intraperitoneal injected with HRS (10 ml/kg). We found that in sepsis, the degree of glycocalyx shedding was directly proportional to the severity of sepsis. The seven-day survival rate of rats in the HRS + CLP group (70%) was higher than that of the CLP group (30%). HRS improved acidosis and renal function and reduced the release of inflammatory factors (TNF, IL-1βand IL-6). The endothelial glycocalyx of capillaries in the HRS + CLP group (115 nm) was observed to be significantly thicker than that in the CLP group (44 nm) and EX527 (67.2 nm) groups by electron microscopy, and fewer glycocalyx metabolites (SDC-1, HS, HA, and MMP9) were found in the blood. Compared with the CLP group, HRS reduced renal apoptosis and upregulated Sirt1 expression, and inhibited the NF-κB/MMP9 signalling pathway. In addition, HRS did not damage immune function in septic rats as well. Generally speaking, our results suggest that HRS can alleviate the inflammatory response, inhibit glycocalyx shedding, improve septic kidney injury, and enhance survival rate.

A recent study reveals a positive interaction between molecular hydrogen (H2) and a heme oxygenase (HO-1) enzyme inducer, cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP), in the inhibition of neuropathic pain provoked by nerve injury. Nevertheless, the efficacy of CoPP co-administered with hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on the allodynia and emotional disorders related to paclitaxel (PTX) administration has not yet been assessed. Using male C57BL/6 mice injected with PTX, we examined the effects of the co-administration of low doses of CoPP and HRW on mechanical and thermal allodynia and anxiodepressive-like behaviors triggered by PTX. Moreover, the impact of this combined treatment on the oxidative stress and inflammation caused by PTX in the amygdala (AMG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were studied. Our results indicated that the antiallodynic actions of the co-administration of CoPP plus HRW are more rapid and higher than those given by each of them when independently administered. This combination inhibited anxiodepressive-like behaviors, the up-regulation of the inflammasome NLRP3 and 4-hydroxynonenal, as well as the high mRNA levels of some inflammatory mediators. This combination also increased the expression of NRF2, HO-1, superoxide dismutase 1, glutathione S-transferase mu 1, and/or the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit and decreased the protein levels of BACH1 in the DRG and/or AMG. Thus, it shows a positive interaction among HO-1 and H2 systems in controlling PTX-induced neuropathy by modulating inflammation and activating the antioxidant system. This study recommends the co-administration of CoPP plus HRW as an effective treatment for PTX-provoked neuropathy and its linked emotive deficits.

Intracellular oxidative stress induced by lipid accumulation leads to various hepatocellular injuries including fibrosis. However, no effective method for mitigating MASLD without substantial side effects currently exists.

Some clinical evidence suggests that H2 may alleviate fatty liver disease, but the precise molecular mechanisms, particularly the regulation of lipid droplet (LD) metabolism, remain unclear. This study utilized an in vitro model of hepatocyte lipid accumulation induced by free fatty acids (FFAs) to replicate MASLD in HepG2 cells. The results demonstrated a significant increase in LD accumulation due to elevated FFA levels. However, the addition of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) effectively reduced LD accumulation. HRW decreased the diameter of LDs and reduced lipid peroxidation and FFA-induced oxidative stress by activating the AMPK/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Overall, our findings suggest that HRW has potential as an adjunctive supplement in managing fatty liver disease by reducing LD accumulation and enhancing antioxidant pathways, presenting a novel strategy for impeding MASLD progression.

Hydrogen has been reported to exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in a rat model induced by monocrotaline of PH. In this study, we investigated the effects of inhaled hydrogen gas on the prevention and treatment of PVOD induced by mitomycin C (MMC) in rats. Methods: PVOD was induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats through intraperitoneal injection of MMC at a concentration of 3 mg·kg- 1·wk- 1 for 2 weeks. Inhalation of hydrogen gas (H2) was administered through a designed rat cage concurrently or two weeks after MMC administration. The severity of PVOD was assessed by using hemodynamic measurements and histological analysis. The expression levels of general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) related proteins in lung tissue were measured. Levels of lipid peroxidation pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum were determined.

However, the combination of hypothermic target temperature management (TTM) and hydrogen inhalation on outcomes is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effect of hydrogen inhalation and hypothermic TTM on outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Design: Post hoc analysis of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Fifteen Japanese ICUs. Patients: Cardiogenic OHCA enrolled in the HYBRID II trial. Interventions: Hydrogen mixed oxygen (hydrogen group) versus oxygen alone (control group). Measurements and main results: TTM was performed at a target temperature of 32-34°C (TTM32-TTM34) or 35-36°C (TTM35-TTM36) per the institutional protocol. The association between hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 and 90-day good neurologic outcomes was analyzed using generalized estimating equations. The 90-day survival was compared between the hydrogen and control groups under TTM32-TTM34 and TTM35-TTM36, respectively. The analysis included 72 patients (hydrogen [ n = 39] and control [ n = 33] groups) with outcome data. TTM32-TTM34 was implemented in 25 (64%) and 24 (73%) patients in the hydrogen and control groups, respectively ( p = 0.46). Under TTM32-TTM34, 17 (68%) and 9 (38%) patients achieved good neurologic outcomes in the hydrogen and control groups, respectively (relative risk: 1.81 [95% CI, 1.05-3.66], p < 0.05). Hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 was independently associated with good neurologic outcomes (adjusted odds ratio 16.10 [95% CI, 1.88-138.17], p = 0.01). However, hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 did not improve survival compared with TTM32-TTM34 alone (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.22 [95% CI, 0.05-1.06], p = 0.06). Conclusions: Hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 was associated with improved neurologic outcomes after cardiogenic OHCA compared with TTM32-TTM34 monotherapy.

In recent years, many studies have shown that molecular hydrogen has therapeutic and preventive effects on various diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether molecular hydrogen could serve as pharmacological intervention agent to reduce risks of reinstatement of opioid seeking and explore the mechanism of gut microbiota base on animal experiments and human studies. Morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) was constructed to establish acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement stage, and the potential impact of H2 on the behaviors related to morphine-induced drug extinction was determined using both free accessible and confined CPP extinction paradigms. The effects of morphine on microbial diversity and composition of microbiota, as well as the subsequent changes after H2 intervention, were assessed using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) in mice serum were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Meanwhile, we also conducted molecular hydrogen intervention and gut microbiota testing in opioid-addicted individuals. Our results revealed that molecular hydrogen could enhance the extinction of morphine-related behavior, reducing morphine reinstatement. Gut microbes may be a potential mechanism behind the therapeutic effects of molecular hydrogen on morphine addiction. Additionally, molecular hydrogen improved symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as gut microbial features, in individuals with opioid addiction.

Molecular hydrogen, known for its antioxidant properties, has shown promise in eliminating reactive oxygen species. However, the low solubility and bioavailability of hydrogen limit the effectiveness of this therapy. To overcome these issues, we developed a novel yolk-shell heterostructure, H-AAZS (Au/Ag@ZnS modified hyaluronic acid), utilizing a hydrothermal cation exchange process. Through ion doping, semiconductor hybridization, and Schottky barriers in H-AAZS, photocatalysis for hydrogen generation has been successfully implemented using 660 nm laser irradiation. Additionally, the H-AAZS demonstrate the capacity for mild photothermal therapy, inducing apoptosis in synovial cells with Au's hot electrons with 660 nm laser irradiation. This strategy not only improves the abnormal proliferation of synovial cells but also avoids the exacerbation of inflammation caused by thermal stimulation. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments validate the synergistic effects of hydrogen production mediated anti-inflammatory responses, macrophage polarization and photothermal therapy. Therefore, this work represents a significant advancement as it ingeniously harnesses photocatalysis to modulate the synovial microenvironment while mitigating the side effects associated with photothermal therapy.

Molecular hydrogen has the potential to specifically counteract reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduce disease severity, and enhance overall health. Investigations of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of oral solid hydrogen capsules (OSHCs) are currently limited, prompting our examination of the beneficial effects of OSHCs. Subsequently, we conducted a clinical study to assess the impact of OSHCs supplementation on individuals with chronic inflammation. Materials and methods: Initially, we evaluated the oxidative reduction potential (ORP) properties of the OSHCs solution by comparing it to hydrogen-rich water (HRW) and calcium hydride (CaH2) treated water. In our outpatient department, stable patients with chronic illnesses who were treated with varying doses of OSHCs were randomized into low-, medium-, and high-dose groups for 4 weeks. Primary outcomes included changes in the serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations after four weeks of OSHCs consumption. Secondary outcomes included changes in the Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwan (BFI-T) fatigue scale, Control Status Scale for Diabetes (CSSD70) scores, and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28). Results: Compared to HRW and CaH2, OSHCs demonstrated a prolonged reduction in ORP for 60 minutes in vitro and enabled a regulated release of hydrogen over 24 hours. A total of 30 participants, with 10 in each dosage (low/medium/high) group, completed the study. The average ESR120 significantly decreased from the first week to the fourth week, with a noticeable dose effect (low-dose group, p = 0.494; high-dose group, p = 0.016). Overall, the average CRP concentration showed a distinct decreasing trend after four weeks of OSHCs administration (w0 vs. w4, p = 0.077). The average DAS28 score demonstrated a significant decrease following OSHCs treatment. Furthermore, there were improvements in the BFI-T and CSSD70 scores.

Post-laminectomy, neutrophils infiltrate the surgical site, generating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that contribute to epidural fibrosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a pivotal role in mediating NETs formation. Molecular hydrogen, recognized for its selective antioxidant properties and biosafety, emerges as a potential therapeutic gas in suppressing epidural fibrosis. In this study, we developed an in-situ hydrogen release hydrogel that inhibits the formation of NETs and mitigates epidural scarring. Biodegradable magnesium (Mg) microspheres served as a hydrogen source, coated with PLGA to regulate hydrogen release. These microspheres (Mg@PLGA) were then incorporated into a PLGA-PEG-PLGA thermosensitive hydrogel (Mg@PLGA@Gel), providing a surgical implant for sustained, long-term hydrogen release. In vitro experiments confirmed the biocompatibility of the system, demonstrating that hydrogen produced by Mg@PLGA effectively neutralizes neutrophil intracellular ROS and inhibits NETs formation.

This study aimed to investigate the modulatory effects of pre-perfusion with hydrogen-rich heparin sodium on the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)/haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway and its potential mechanisms in mitigating skeletal muscle IRI post-limb replantation. Methods: Forty healthy Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were classified into five groups (n = 8 each): normal control, IRI + heparin sodium pre-perfusion (heparin group), IRI + hydrogen-rich heparin sodium pre-perfusion (hydrogen-rich heparin group), IRI + hydrogen-rich heparin sodium pre-perfusion + NRF2 inhibitor (hydrogen-rich heparin + all-trans retinoic acid [ATRA] group), and IRI + heparin sodium pre-perfusion + NRF2 inhibitor (heparin + ATRA group). The activation of the NRF2/HO-1 pathway in skeletal muscle IRI was evaluated based on HO-1 expression using western blotting and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, haematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy were employed to determine the histopathological characteristics. Additionally, superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde levels in skeletal muscle tissue were measured to assess antioxidant capacity and the degree of oxidative stress damage. Tissue hypoxia was assessed based on hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha expression, whereas apoptosis markers BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) and Caspase-3 in skeletal muscle tissues were analysed using western blotting with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling staining to quantify cell apoptosis. Results: Compared with the control group, the heparin group exhibited significant pathological changes, including inflammatory infiltration and cellular hypertrophy, with increased apoptosis and oxidative stress. Notably, NRF2 suppression aggravated these effects. However, hydrogen-rich heparin sodium prominently activated the NRF2/HO-1 pathway, enhancing antioxidant defence and reducing BAX/Caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, thereby mitigating IRI-induced damage. The use of an NRF2 inhibitor to inhibit NRF2 excitation by hydrogen-rich heparin sodium notably weakened NRF2 activation and the antioxidant response, resulting in a substantial increase in cellular apoptosis.

An In Vitro Pilot Study ,2024,Biomedicines,10.3390/biomedicines12081883 ,"Extracorporeal circulation (ECC) is frequently implemented in a vast array of modalities such as hemodialysis, cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and others. Patients receiving any such therapy are frequently encumbered with chronic inflammation, which is inherently accompanied by oxidative stress. However, ECC treatments themselves are also responsible for sustaining or promoting inflammation. On these grounds, an in vitro study was designed to investigate the therapeutic potential of molecular hydrogen (H2) against pro-inflammatory agents in ECC settings. Five miniature ECMO circuits and a small vial (Control) were primed with heparinized blood from healthy adult donors (n = 7). Three of the ECMO systems were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), out of which one was additionally treated with an H2 gas mixture. After 6 h, samples were drawn for the assessment of specific biomarkers (MCP-1, MPO, MDA-a, TRX1, and IL-6). Preliminary results indicate a progressive oxidative and inflammatory response between the six systems. Circulation has triggered inflammation and blood trauma, but the staggering influence of LPS in this outcome is indisputable. Accordingly, hydrogen's remedial potential becomes immediately apparent as biomarker concentrations tend to be lower in the H2-handled circuit. Future research should have distinct objectives (e.g., dosage/duration/cycle of hydrogen administration) in order to ascertain the optimal protocol for patient treatment.

The mechanism of this damage involves mucosal compression ischemia and the oxidative stress injury following reperfusion. Currently, there is a lack of effective strategies to protect the mucosa. Hydrogen, as a natural antioxidant, has demonstrated significant potential in the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress injuries. This study aimed to determine the protective effects of hydrogen on compressed airway mucosa. We found that the damage to the airway mucosa caused by ETT cuff compression was associated with oxidative stress-induced pyroptosis of airway epithelial cells. Inhalation of hydrogen effectively reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species, significantly ameliorating changes in epithelial cell pyroptosis, and this protective effect is linked to the inhibition of the NLRP3-GSDMD pathway. Further cellular studies, involving knockdown and overexpression of NLRP3, clarified that hydrogen exerts its protective effects on the airway mucosa by inhibiting epithelial cell pyroptosis. Additionally, we observed that using hydrogen-rich saline to inflate the ETT cuff in patients under general anesthesia significantly reduced postoperative sore throat. This study confirms that hydrogen effectively enhances tolerance of airway mucosa to oxidative stress injuries, offering a potential preventive and therapeutic strategy for protecting the airway mucosa in patients undergoing endotracheal intubation.

In a rat model simulating pulmonary fibrotic changes induced by monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension (MPH), we had previously explored the impact of inhaled H2 on lung inflammation and blood pressure. In this study, we further focused the biological effects of H2 on mast cells (MCs) and the parameters of the fibrotic phenotype of the local tissue microenvironment. MPH resulted in a significantly increased number of MCs in both the pneumatic and respiratory parts of the lungs, an increased number of tryptase-positive MCs with increased expression of TGF-β, activated interaction with immunocompetent cells (macrophages and plasma cells) and fibroblasts, and increased MC colocalization with a fibrous component of the extracellular matrix of connective tissue. The alteration in the properties of the MC population occurred together with intensified collagen fibrillogenesis and an increase in the integral volume of collagen and elastic fibers of the extracellular matrix of the pulmonary connective tissue. The exposure of H2 together with monocrotaline (MCT), despite individual differences between animals, tended to decrease the intrapulmonary MC population and the severity of the fibrotic phenotype of the local tissue microenvironment compared to changes in animals exposed to the MCT effect alone. In addition, the activity of collagen fibrillogenesis associated with MCs and the expression of TGF-β and tryptase in MCs decreased, accompanied by a reduction in the absolute and relative content of reticular and elastic fibers in the lung stroma. Thus, with MCT exposure, inhaled H2 has antifibrotic effects involving MCs in the lungs of rats.

Methods: Twelve type 2 diabetic mice were divided into a group that received non-hydrogen water (n = 6, control group) and the other that received hydrogen-rich water (0.6-0.8 mM) (n = 6, HRW group) from six weeks of age. Body weight, blood glucose, intraocular pressure, and blood pressure were evaluated from eight to 14 weeks of age. RBF was measured in the vascular area of the optic disc as mean blur rate using laser speckle flowgraphy in the resting state and response to flicker stimulation and hyperoxia. We evaluated glial activation and oxidative stress based on immunofluorescence expression. Results: At 14 weeks, blood glucose level was significantly lower in the HRW group, though still elevated. RBF changes improved significantly in the HRW group compared with the control group from eight weeks of age and persisted throughout the study. Immunofluorescent expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, particularly in the outer plexiform layer, was significantly decreased in the HRW group. Among oxidative stress markers, 3-nitrotyrosine was significantly suppressed in the HRW group. Conclusions: Hydrogen-rich water intake significantly improved RBF dysregulation in diabetic mice.

Considering the stubborn nature and depth of tissue infection, rapid and effective treatments for osteomyelitis remain an enormous challenge. Calcium hydride (CaH2), as efficient hydrogen/alkaline/calcium donors, is employed for combined osteomyelitis therapy. CaH2 reacts with water to sufficiently generate a strong alkali environment with hydroxide anions (OH-) to inhibit bacterial proliferation and induce bacterial death. The released calcium ions (Ca2+) induce calcium overload to kill bacteria first and then serves as calcium source to promote new bone formation. Another byproduct, hydrogen enhances the bacterial membrane permeability and scavenges excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). After incubation with bacteria, CaH2 significantly increases the permeability of the bacterial membrane, therefore increasing the entry of OH- and Ca2+ into bacterial cells, thereby leading to significant bacterial death. After being applied to S. aureus-infected mouse tibia osteomyelitis, CaH2 materials efficiently kill bacteria, relieve local inflammation, and promote new bone formation in a short time. Overall, bioactive metal hydride-associated ""triple"" hydrogen/alkaline/calcium therapy provides a new idea for the treatment of deep-site bacterial infection, which is beneficial for relieving the pressure caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Statins is prescribed as the primary medication to decrease lipid levels. Recent research has demonstrated that hydrogen possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties by modulating the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α, ultimately leading to the preservation of lipid homeostasis. Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a prolonged stable hydrogen storage medium, which can be utilized to investigate its synergistic lipid-lowering effect with statins and its detailed molecular mechanism, both in vivo and in vitro. To ascertain the safety and efficacy of MgH2, we executed a comprehensive research of its influence on both physiological and pathological metrics. We noted a substantial diminution in lipid levels when MgH2 was integrated with atorvastatin, as attested by oil red staining. Furthermore, we scrutinized the regulatory effect of MgH2 on cytochrome P450 3A, which is a metabolic enzyme of statins, and discovered that it could be reduced by the MgH2. Concluding from our results, we propose that MgH2 inhibits the expression of cytochrome P450 3A in the liver and exerts an auxiliary lipid-lowering effect by increasing the blood concentration of statins.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of inhaling high concentration hydrogen on septic mice with AKI and to examine the involvement of mitochondria in this process. High concentration hydrogen does not cause hypoxia and can alleviate AKI and improve 7-day survival in septic mice. Inflammatory factors are markedly elevated in the serum and renal tissues in CLP group which are dramatically down-regulated by hydrogen. The activities of both antioxidant enzymes are significantly reduced after CLP, whereas hydrogen markedly increases the activities of SOD and CAT. MMP is found to be significantly lower in CLP group whereas this effect is reversed by hydrogen. The trend of ATP content in renal tissues corresponded with that of MMP. There is a substantial downregulation of PGC-1α, Nrf2, and TFAM protein in CLP group.

The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of molecular hydrogen (H2) highlight its potential to be as an effective nutritional supplement to support muscular function performance in healthy adults. However, the effects of H2 supplementation on muscular endurance performance in trained individuals have not been well characterized. This study aimed to assess the effects of intermittent hydrogen-rich water (HRW) supplementation before, during, and after resistance training on muscular endurance performance, neuromuscular status, and subjective perceptual responses after a 48-h recovery period. Methods: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study included 18 trained men aged 19.7 ± 0.9 years. Participants in this study were instructed to consume 1,920 mL of HRW or pure water (Placebo) daily for 7 days. Additionally, participants were required to supplement with HRW or pure water five times during the training day (1,260 mL total). This included drinking 210 mL 30 min and 1 min before training, 210 mL between training sets, 210 mL immediately after training, and 420 mL 30 min into the recovery period. Participants performed half-squat exercises with the load set at 70% of one repetition maximum for six sets (half-squat exercise performed to repetitions failure each set). We measured the power output and number of repetitions in the free barbell half-squat used to assess muscular endurance performance in participants. The countermovement jump (CMJ) height, total quality recovery scale (TQRS), and muscle soreness visual analog scale (VAS) scores were measured to assess fatigue recovery status after training, as well as at 24 and 48 h of recovery. Results: The total power output (HRW: 50,866.7 ± 6,359.9W, Placebo: 46,431.0 ± 9,376.5W, p = 0.032) and the total number of repetitions (HRW:78.2 ± 9.5 repetitions, Placebo: 70.3 ± 9.5 repetitions, p = 0.019) in the H2 supplemented group were significantly higher than in the placebo group. However, there was no statistically significant difference (p< 0.05) between the H2 and placebo groups in CMJ, TQRS, and VAS. Conclusion: Eight days of intermittent HRW intake could significantly improve muscular endurance performance in trained individuals, making it a promising strategy for athletes or fitness enthusiasts looking to boost muscular endurance during resistance training or competitions.

Electrolysis of H2O by electrocatalysts sustainably releases enormous amounts of H2 and inspires the precise delivery of H2 for tumor therapy. Herein, manganese-doped Ni2S3 nanoelectrodes (MnNi2S3 NEs) are designed for the electrocatalytic delivery of H2 and the activation of antitumor immunity to effectively potentiate H2-immunotherapy. Ni atoms featuring empty 3d orbitals reduce the initial energy barrier of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by promoting the adsorption of H2O. Moreover, Mn atoms with different electronegativity modulate the electronic structure of Ni atoms and facilitate the desorption of the generated H2, thus enhancing the HER activity of the MnNi2S3 NEs. Based on the high HER activity, controllable delivery of H2 for electrocatalytic hydrogen therapy (EHT) is achieved in a voltage-dependent manner. Mechanistically, MnNi2S3 NE-mediated EHT induces mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which subsequently activates pyroptosis through the typical ROS/caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway. Furthermore, MnNi2S3 NE-mediated EHT enhances the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes into tumors and reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment.

Each group was analyzed at 12-hour (h) and 48-hour (h) time points with five replicates, totaling 40 samples. The experimental results highlighted the HRW800ppb group as the top production in terms of gas production and CH4 content. In contrast, the HRW200ppb group exhibited significantly lower methane levels at both 12 h and 48 h (P < 0.05). Regarding rumen fermentation, the HRW400ppb group significantly increased the levels of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and microbial crude protein (MCP) at 12 h fermentation, but reduced the dry matter degradation rate (P < 0.05). After 48 h, the HRW400ppb group had highest MCP content (P < 0.05), but no significant differences in NH3-N and dry matter degradation rate compared with the CON group (P > 0.05). Although HRW did not significantly benefit the synthesis of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) and individual VFA, the HRW800ppb group significantly increased the ratio of acetate to propionate (P < 0.05). Based on CH4 emissions and MCP synthesis, we selected the HRW400ppb group for subsequent bacterial community analysis. Bacterial community analysis showed that at 12 h, compared with the CON group, the Bacterial community analysis revealed that the HRW400ppb group had significant increases in the Simpson index, Firmicutes, Streptococcus, Schwartzia, Prevotellaceae_YAB2003_group, and Oribacterium, and decreases in Prevotella, Ruminobacter, Succinivibrio, unclassified_Succinivibrionaceae, and Prevotellaceae_UCG-003 (P < 0.05).

This study aimed to explore the impact of hydrogen (H2) on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury in H9c2 cells (derived from rat embryonic heart tissue) induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and to elucidate its underlying mechanism. An H/R injury model was established in H9c2 cells via exposure to 15 μM H2O2 for 3 hours, followed by incubation in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C for 24 hours. Then, the cells were treated with H2 (50%) for 6, 12 or 24 hours. The results demonstrated that H9c2 cells exposed to H2O2 and subjected to H/R injury presented a marked decrease in the cell survival rate, accompanied by severe morphological alterations, such as curling and wrinkling, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Notably, H2 mitigated H/R injury induced by H2O2 in a time-dependent manner, improving the morphological damage observed in H9c2 cells and decreasing lactate dehydrogenase levels. Compared with the model group, treatment with H2 increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, while concurrently reducing the level of malondialdehyde, an indicator of cellular damage. Furthermore, H2 treatment downregulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory-related factors, specifically interleukin-6, high-mobility group box 1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and Toll-like receptor 4, in H9c2 cells post-H/R injury. Furthermore, H2 treatment resulted in a marked decrease in the expression levels of proteins associated with the Wnt/C-X3-C-motif receptor 1 signaling pathway, such as β-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, adenomatous polyposis coli, and Wnt and C-X3-C-motif receptor 1. This observation suggests a potential mechanism for its protective effects against H/R injury. Therefore, H2 exerts a protective effect against H/R injury in H9c2 cells induced by H2O2, potentially by inhibiting the activated Wnt/C-X3-C-motif receptor 1 signaling pathway. This inhibition, in turn, prevents the generation of oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and inflammation-associated factors.

However, the efficacy of H2 treatment modalities is compromised by their reliance on systemic gas administration or chemical reactions generation, which suffers from low efficiency, poor targeting, and suboptimal utilization. In this study, living therapeutics are employed using photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides for in situ H2 production combined with near-infrared (NIR) mediated photothermal therapy. Living R. sphaeroides exhibits strong absorption in the NIR spectrum, effectively converting light energy into thermal energy while concurrently generating H2. This dual functionality facilitates the targeted induction of tumor cell death and substantially reduces collateral damage to adjacent normal tissues. The findings reveal that integrating hydrogen therapy with photothermal effects, mediated through photosynthetic bacteria, provides a robust, dual-modality approach that enhances the overall efficacy of tumor treatments. This living therapeutic strategy not only leverages the therapeutic potential of both hydrogen and photothermal therapeutic modalities but also protects healthy tissues, marking a significant advancement in cancer therapy techniques.

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of H2 gas inhalation during concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC). Patients and methods: We designed a pilot prospective study combining CCRT with aerosol inhalation of H2 gas. Each patient was scheduled to receive daily intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in 33 fractions on a weekday and six cycles of weekly chemotherapy. All patients inhaled H2 gas through a cannula or mask 1 hour per day, 1-2 hours before IMRT. The primary endpoint was the feasibility of H2 inhalation. Eighty percent of the patients who completed at least 20 applications of H2 gas inhalation were considered feasible. The secondary endpoints were safety profiles during H2 gas inhalation (vital signs and symptoms related to H2 gas inhalation) and acute toxicities during CCRT. Results: We enrolled 10 patients with LAHNC between July 2023 and December 2023. All patients received 33 fractions of H2 gas inhalation on the same day as the IMRT. Vital signs during and at the end of H2 gas inhalation were stable in all patients. None of the 10 patients had hypertension or hypotension during any of the 33 inhalations. No adverse events related to H2 gas inhalation, such as cough, nasal bleeding, dizziness, headache, nausea, or vomiting, were reported. Grade 3 leukopenia was found in two patients (20%) during the 5th week of CCRT. Grade 2 radiation dermatitis and pharyngitis were found in three patients (30%).

The hydrolysis of NH3BH3 on the PtNPs facilitates the continuous release of H2 gas from the open-end terminus, driving its forward movement. Unlike conventional O2 bubbles' systems that rely on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as fuel, these micromotors can operate in the presence of live cells within the NH3BH3 medium. Consequently, micromotors functionalized with the lectin concanavalin A demonstrate the capability to capture and release Escherichia coli (E. coli) without inducing cell death. Remaining bacteria can be detected by using standard culture techniques. Conversely, micromotors coated with TiO2 nanoparticles enable photosterilization of E. coli without fuel-induced damage. The self-stirring motion of the tubes enhances both bacterial capture and sterilization efficiency.

The reconstruction of bone defects with horizontal and vertical components using particulated bone grafts requires the placement of a mechanically stable structure for stabilization of the grafting material. Although titanium-reinforced membranes and titanium meshes have been shown to be effective in this indication, the necessity of their removal, often in a separate surgical procedure, is seen as a disadvantage. Since the introduction of a new resorbable magnesium metal membrane and fixation screw, a mechanically stable and resorbable system might provide an alternative option for guided bone regeneration (GBR) in the posterior mandible. Case Presentation: A 61-year-old patient was presented with large edentulous areas in all posterior regions and requested fixed dentures in Areas 34-36. Tooth 33 was extracted and treated with an immediate implantation of a ceramic implant, whereas Positions 34-36 were treated with a two-stage approach. The site was augmented horizontally, with a slight vertical component using autologous and allogenic bone and a new completely resorbable magnesium metal membrane and fixation screw. During the initial healing period, the patient reported a tingling sensation at the site of the augmentation. This is an observation that is specific to the magnesium products and is potentially caused by the release of hydrogen gas as the metal degrades and is resorbed. Upon re-entry at 3 months, it was clinically observed that there was a very dense and vascularized bone that was sufficient for placing two 5.5 × 10 mm ceramic dental implants. Conclusion: A completely resorbable magnesium membrane and fixation screw were able to support the bony regeneration in a large GBR situation in the posterior mandible. Due to the use of a new material for GBR, different clinical observations were made compared to the standard material choices.

Adult male C57BL/6 mice underwent bilateral common carotid artery stenosis to induce VaD and were subsequently assigned to three groups: VaD, VaD with hydrogen-rich water treatment (VaD + H2), and Sham controls. Behavioral assessments using open field and novel object recognition tests revealed that VaD mice exhibited anxiety-deficient behavior and memory impairment, both of which were reversed by H2 treatment. Histological examinations showed pyknotic neuronal morphologies and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the VaD hippocampus, whereas H2 administration mitigated these alterations. Furthermore, VaD-induced downregulation of BCL2 was reversed in the VaD + H2 group, in parallel with increased IL-4 expression. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that VaD disrupted T regulatory cell homeostasis by significantly increasing their proportion, an effect reversed by H2 treatment, thereby restoring immunological balance.

However, its clinical indications and the corresponding appropriate hydrogen delivery methods have yet to be determined. This is due to the fact that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of hydrogen in each delivery method have not been experimentally proven. Here, we verified the pharmacokinetics of hydrogen after the infusion of hydrogen-saturated saline. Methods: Hydrogen-saturated saline was prepared and checked for sterility and component specifications. Hydrogen-saturated saline was administered intravenously (125 mL/h) through the left internal jugular vein of pigs, and the blood hydrogen concentration was measured over time. Results: It was confirmed that hydrogen can be safely mixed under pressure into intravenous solutions (pharmaceutical products) without the contamination of foreign substances by using a needle-less vial access cannula. No change in the PH or composition of the solution was observed due to hydrogen filling. The hydrogen concentrations of blood samples collected from the left internal jugular vein 3 cm to the heart from the tip of the infusion line were 6.4 (30 min), 4.7 (60 min), 4.9 (90 min), and 5.3 (120 min) ppb w/w, respectively. The hydrogen concentrations of blood samples collected from the right atrium were 0.7 (30 min), 0.5 (60 min), 0.7 (90 min), and 0.7 (120 min) ppb, respectively. The hydrogen concentration of blood samples collected from the right internal carotid artery were 0.1 (pre), 0.2 (30 min), 0.3 (60 min), 0.0 (90 min), and 0.0 (120 min) ppb w/w, respectively. Conclusions: We confirmed that hydrogen could be safely pressurized and filled into intravenous (pharmaceutical) solution without contamination by foreign objects using a needle-free vial access cannula. When saturated hydrogen saline was dripped intravenously, almost all of the hydrogen was expelled during its passage through the lungs and could not be supplied to the arterial side.

Methods: Pt NPs + H2 formulation was synthesized to address OIR in a rat model. Subsequent examination included the assessment of retinal blood vessel distribution and morphology through hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and isolectin B4 (IB4) staining techniques. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde(MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured to reflect the oxidative stress in rats. Additionally, the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in each experimental group was assessed using western blot analysis, while the gene expression of VEGF in retinal neovascularization tissues was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, the extent of retinal cell apoptosis was measured using a TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) apoptosis kit. Results: HE staining and IB4 staining revealed positive retinal neovascularization in the OIR group, whereas neovascularization in the Pt NPs + H2 group exhibited reduced severity. Significantly fewer capillary globules and capillary tubules were observed in the Pt NPs + H2 group compared to the OIR group (p < 0.05). Also, the Pt NPs + H2 group demonstrated significant reductions in ROS and MDA levels within retinal tissues (p < 0.05, p < 0.001), along with a significant increase in SOD level (p < 0.05). Notably, the MDA level in the Pt NPs + H2 group was notably lower than that in the OIR group (p < 0.01, p < 0.05), and even lower than that in the H2 group. Pt NPs + H2 intervention was associated with decreased protein and mRNA expression of VEGF, with statistical significance (p < 0.05). While the H2 group exhibited a decreasing trend in apoptotic cell count in the retinal ganglion cell layer (p < 0.05), the Pt NPs + H2 group demonstrated a more pronounced reduction, with a significant difference (p < 0.01). No significant discrepancy in apoptosis within the inner nuclear layer was observed (p > 0.05).

Zebrafish were exposed to aluminum chloride to induce AD-like pathology and then treated with HRW using a nanobubble device. Behavioral assays, ELISA, Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil fluorescence labeling were employed to assess HRW's impact. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing analyzed HRW's effect on gut microbiota. HRW can significantly improve cognitive impairment and depression-like behavior in zebrafish AD model, reduce Aβ deposition (p < 0.0001), regulate liver Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) levels (p < 0.05), reduce neuroinflammation, and reduce oxidative stress. Furthermore, HRW reduced the number of harmful bacteria linked to AD pathology by restoring the balance of microbiota in the gut.

However, the exact effects of generated Mg ions (Mg2+), hydrogen gas (H2), and hydroxide ions (OH-) by Mg degradation on enhancing fracture healing are not fully understood. Here we investigate the in vivo degradation of Mg intramedullary nail (Mg-IMN), revealing the generation of these degradation products around the fracture site during early stages. Bulk-RNA seq indicates that H2 and alkaline pH increase periosteal cell proliferation, while Mg2+ may mainly enhance extracellular matrix formation and cell adhesion in the femur ex vivo. In vivo studies further reveal that H2, Mg2+ and alkaline pH individually generate comparable effects to the enhanced bone regeneration in the Mg-IMN group. Mechanistically, the degradation products elevate sensory calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and simultaneously suppress adrenergic factors in newly formed bone. H2 and Mg2+, instead of alkaline pH, increase CGRP synthesis and inhibit adrenergic receptors. Our findings, for the first time, elucidate that Mg2+, H2, and alkaline pH environment generated by Mg-IMN act distinctly and synergistically mediated by the skeletal interoceptive regulation to accelerate bone regeneration.

We found that 45 metabolites were significantly changed between the VSD + HRS group and the VSD + saline-treated group. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that biotin metabolism was the potential target pathway. The biochemical interpretation analysis demonstrated that combining HRS and VSD might enhance mitochondrial function, ATP synthesis, and GSH homeostasis by altering biotin metabolism. The detection of representative indicators of oxidative stress supported the critical metabolic pathway analysis as well.

Following continuous AngII administration for a 28-day period, AngII+H2 treated rats showed decreased susceptibility to AF, a decrease in atrial fibrosis, a decrease in ROS in atrial myocytes, an inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, an improvement in electrical remodeling, and an inhibition of proliferation and migration of cardiac fibroblasts. We further found that hydrogen regulates the activation of inflammasome and thus improves Ca2+ handling and IKAch and IKur by inhibiting the activity of NOX4 in vivo. In addition, hydrogen was involved in AngII-mediated atrial fibrosis through inhibiting TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway through suppressing TGF-β1 activation and secretion in vivo.

However, tumor metabolism, particularly glycolysis, negatively regulates the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Herein, Mn galvanic cells (MnG) are prepared via liquid-phase exfoliation and in situ galvanic replacement to modulate tumor metabolism, thereby enhancing cGAS-STING activation for bidirectional synergistic H2-immunotherapy. The obtained MnG can be etched by water, enabling efficient and sustained generation of H2 gas and Mn2+.

Oxidative damage is a novel determinant of spinal pruriceptive sensitization and synaptic plasticity. The resolution of oxidative insult by molecular hydrogen has been manifested. Herein, we strikingly report that both hydrogen gas (2 %) inhalation and hydrogen-rich saline (5 mL/kg, intraperitoneal) injection prevent and alleviate persistent dermatitis-induced itch, diabetic itch and cholestatic itch. Hydrogen therapy reverses the decrease of spinal SIRT1 expression and antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx and CAT) activity after dermatitis, diabetes and cholestasis. Furthermore, hydrogen reduces spinal ROS generation, oxidation products (MDA, 8-OHdG and 3-NT) accumulation, β-catenin acetylation and dendritic spine density in persistent itch models. Spinal SIRT1 inhibition eliminates antipruritic and antioxidative effects of hydrogen, while SIRT1 agonism attenuates chronic itch phenotype, spinal β-catenin acetylation and mitochondrial damage. β-catenin inhibitors are effective against chronic itch via reducing β-catenin acetylation, blocking ERK phosphorylation and elevating antioxidant enzymes activity. Hydrogen treatment suppressed dermatitis and cholestasis mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in vitro. Additionally, hydrogen impairs cholestasis-induced the enhancement of cerebral functional connectivity between the right primary cingulate cortex and bilateral sensorimotor cortex, as well as bilateral striatum. Taken together, this study uncovers that molecular hydrogen protects against chronic pruritus and spinal pruriceptive sensitization by reducing oxidative damage via up-regulation of SIRT1-dependent β-catenin deacetylation in mice, implying a promising strategy in translational development for itch control.

Furthermore, in vivo experiments reveal that exposing irradiated skin areas to a hydrogen gas environment alleviates RD. Assessment of skin appearance grade and histology staining revealed that direct transdermal application of hydrogen can prevent radiation-induced follicle damage, dermal thickening, and leukocyte infiltration, thereby reducing the severity of RD. In addition, hydrogen enhances the skin's antioxidant capacity, leading to a reduction in the Bcl-2-associated X protein/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio, the number of apoptotic cells, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Molecular hydrogen has been proven to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but few studies have investigated its effects on osteoarthritis. Our study aims to assess the therapeutic potential of hydrogen-oxygen mixture (H2-O2) inhalation for KOA. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, eligible elderly KOA patients were randomly assigned to either Group H or Group C. Both groups participated in a 12-week home-based exercise (HBE) program, which included knee-joint exercises and health education. Group H additionally received H2-O2 inhalation for 60 min per day over 2 weeks, while Group C did not. The primary outcome was measured using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes included inflammation levels (hs-CRP, NLR, PLR, LMR), Chair Stand Test (CST), Timed Up and Go (TUG), 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS), and adverse events. Results: A total of 121 subjects were enrolled, with an average age of 81.2 years, and 80.2% were female. The between-group mean difference in the WOMAC total score was -5.2 (95% CI -12.1 to 1.7, P = 0.140) at week 12, with Group H showing an improvement of -22.9 (95% CI -26.3 to -19.6, P < 0.001) and Group C showing an improvement of -19.4 (95% CI -22.7 to -16.0, P < 0.001) compared to baseline, revealing a significant group × time interaction (F (3, 356.034) = 14.425, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between both groups at week 12 in CST, TUG, SF-36 scores, EARS scores, or the incidence of adverse events. Conclusion: Although clinical significance was not achieved, H2-O2 inhalation alleviated KOA symptoms and enhanced functional activity in elderly patients undergoing the HBE program during the initial 2 weeks.

The liver, a pivotal organ responsible for metabolic equilibrium, is particularly vulnerable to its adverse effects. This study delves into the hepatoprotective properties of extended consumption of HRW in mice subjected to chronic stress. Methods: Mice subjected to chronic stress via CUMS and HRW administration for seven months underwent liver pathological examination. Key liver function indicators (AST, ALT), oxidative stress markers (SOD, CAT, GSH), and markers related to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis (MDA, Fe) were measured using standard kits. ELISA determined corticosterone and 4-HNE levels. Immunofluorescence evaluated ROS, Nrf2, and apoptosis in liver tissues. Western blotting analyzed markers for ferroptosis (GPX4, SLC7A11, HO-1, Nrf2), apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2, Cytc, Caspase-3, Caspase-8), mitochondrial biogenesis (Nrf1, PGC-1α, Tfam), and quality control (Drp1, Fis1, Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1, PINK1, Parkin, LC3 I/II). Results: The findings indicate a noteworthy improvement in liver health among mice exposed to HRW, as evidenced by histological analysis. Furthermore, the consumption of HRW exhibited hepatoprotection, as evidenced by the normalization of AST and ALT levels. Mechanistically, our results indicate that HRW elevates the levels of SOD, CAT, and GSH, while effectively clearing ROS within mitochondria. It was observed led to a regulation in the expression of mitochondrial quality control proteins, consequently improving mitochondrial biogenesis (Nrf1, PGC-1α, Tfam), and increasing ATP production. Furthermore, HRW decreased Cytc, Bax, Caspase-3, and Caspase-8 levels, and increasing the expression of Bcl-2. Additionally, HRW reduced MDA and 4-HNE levels, alleviating ferroptosis through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and upregulating the expression of GPX4 and SLC7A11. By mitigating hepatocyte death through the aforementioned mechanisms, HRW fulfills its crucial role in safeguarding liver health. Conclusions: This study reveals that long-term hydrogen-rich water (HRW) consumption provides significant hepatoprotection in mice under chronic stress. HRW normalizes liver enzyme levels, enhances antioxidant capacity, and reduces lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. It improves mitochondrial biogenesis, function, and ATP production, and attenuates apoptosis by modulating related proteins. Behavioral tests show HRW alleviates stress-induced anxiety and enhances exploratory behavior. These findings suggest HRW is a promising non-invasive intervention for preventing and treating stress-related liver disorders by targeting oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.",Positive,Mouse,Liver,Stress Resilience,Hepatoprotection,Water (Electrolysis),Neutral,Ingestion,,,China

Despite its clinical relevance, the underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood, and existing therapies have limited efficacy. A recent study in mouse model revealed that overactivation of the intrarenal SPAK (STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine rich protein kinase)-sodium chloride co-transporter (NCC) pathway in the distal renal tubule is a crucial mechanism contributing to nocturnal polyuria. Here, we demonstrate that increased oxidative stress in the kidney activates the NCC, leading to insufficient sodium excretion during the active period and compensatory sodium excretion during the inactive period, resulting in polyuria during the inactive period. In addition, we show that a newly developed antioxidant-a silicon component agent-reduced oxidative stress and inhibited NCC activation, resulting in the amelioration of polyuria during the inactive period. These findings highlight the critical contributions of intrarenal oxidative stress to the pathogenesis of nocturnal polyuria and suggest that silicon-based agent holds promise for clinical application as a novel treatment for nocturnal polyuria.

Its selective antioxidant properties against hydroxyl radicals, which are responsible for the indirect effects of ionizing radiation, may make it worthy of attention as a new radio-protector. We recently developed new hydrogen water that is more stable and has higher antioxidant activity by using ultra-fine bubbles. In this study, female C57BL/6J mice given ad libitum access to ultra-fine bubble hydrogen water (UBHW) were subjected to whole-body irradiation (WBI) with X-rays, and the radio-protective effect of UBHW was evaluated. WBI with 6.0 Gy (sub-lethal dose) resulted in a 30-day survival rate of 100% in UBHW-fed mice, compared with 37% in control mice. In the case of WBI with 6.5 Gy (lethal dose), while the control mice died out in about 3 weeks, the 30-day survival rate improved to 40% by UBHW due to the high scavenging activity of hydroxy radicals. Twenty-six serum proteins involved in inflammatory and immune responses were significantly identified in UBHW-fed mice by proteomics, and UBHW may enhance and regulate these functions, resulting in reduced damage in mice exposed to WBI. We conclude that UBHW has good potential in radio-protection, with evidence that warrants further research efforts in this field.

We previously identified that breathing hydrogen can significantly inhibit early inflammation, activate autologous stem cells, and promote the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the broader functions and downstream targets of hydrogen-induced ECM accumulation and tissue remodeling are unknown in the wound-healing process. Methods: Consequently, this thesis developed a hydrogen sustained-release dressing based on a micro storage material and reveals the mechanism of hydrogen in treating wound healing. Upon encapsulating the hydrogen storage materials, magnesium (Mg), and ammonia borane (AB), we found that SiO2@Mg exhibits superior sustained-release performance, while SiO2@AB demonstrates a higher hydrogen storage capacity. We used a C57/BL6 mouse full-thickness skin defect wound model to analyze and compare different hydrogen dressings. Results: It was identified that hydrogen dressings can significantly improve the healing rate of wounds by promoting epithelialization, angiogenesis, and collagen accumulation in wound tissue, and that the effect of slow-release dressings is better than of non-slow-release dressings. We also found that hydrogen dressing can promote transcriptome-level expression related to cell proliferation and differentiation and ECM accumulation, mainly through the Wnt1/β-catenin pathway and TGF-β1/Smad2 pathway.

Individual variations in the ability to degrade dietary fiber are influenced by the gut microbiome that may be associated with the host's metabolic phenotype and genetic diversity. This is exemplified by the distinct fiber digestibility observed in obese (e.g. Meishan) and lean-breed (e.g. Yorkshire) pigs. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study found that with the same diet under the same environment, the obese-type Meishan pigs showed greater dietary fiber digestibility and harbored higher abundances of polysaccharide-degrading bacteria (Bacteroides, Treponema, and Paraprevotella) compared to lean-type Yorkshire pigs. Metatranscriptomic profiling revealed that the elevated presence of Bacteroides contributed to the enrichment of carbohydrate-active enzymes, particularly those degrading arabinoxylan, indicating a preference for arabinoxylan as a substrate in Meishan pigs. Further enzymatic-product measurements, combined with microbial enzyme profiles, validated greater microbial conversion of xylose into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in Meishan pigs. Additionally, higher abundances of hydrogenotrophic microbes (Methanobrevibacter and Blautia) were detected in the Meishan gut, along with the enrichment of methanogenesis and acetogenesis pathways. To determine whether methanogenesis drives inter-breed variation in arabinoxylan degradation, an in vitro experiment using the methanogen inhibitor, 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) was performed. The results confirmed that Meishan gut microbiome effectively reduced hydrogen accumulation through methanogenesis, promoting arabinoxylan degradation. Conversely, inhibiting methanogenesis by BES led to hydrogen accumulation, reduced SCFAs, β-xylosidase activity, and Bacteroides abundances. These findings demonstrate that the Meishan pigs have a superior ability of dietary fiber utilization with greater microbial conversion to more SCFAs, which is linked to stronger hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. This study reinforces the role of gut microbial hydrogenotrophy in dietary fiber utilization in pigs. ",Positive,Pig,Intestine,Obesity,Gut Microbiome,Gas,N/A,In Vivo Biotic Production,,,China

Despite hydrogen being a prospective molecule for anti-inflammatory effects, the on-demand delivery of hydrogen that could synchronize with the dynamic inflammation stages has yet remained unaddressed. Moreover, its specific immunomodulatory mechanisms are still veiled. In this study, we introduced ISO-ZIF-8@AB, a hydrogen-generating nanoplatform that integrated visible-light photocatalysis and hydrolysis reactions to achieve controllable hydrogen release on demand, functioning with an initial peak release and following a sustained release. With ISO-ZIF-8@AB further loaded into an aligned ECM-like scaffold, the complex significantly alleviated inflammation and prevented protracted unhealing. The bulk-RNA sequencing combined with single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that hydrogen treatment effectively reduced the excessive aggregation and infiltration of innate immune cells. Specifically, hydrogen reduced the proportion of Ptgs2+Nos2+ pro-inflammatory macrophages (PIMs) by mitigating mitochondrial stress and suppressing HIF-1α-induced glycolysis, the immune-metabolic regulation of which reduced harmful crosstalk between PIMs and hypodermal fibroblasts and facilitated extracellular matrix production accompanied by the ultimate wound repair. Overall, this study presented a strategy for controllable hydrogen release in terms of timing and rate, with further discussions regarding the underlying immune-metabolic regulation mechanisms of hydrogen therapy.

Although gas therapies hold promise for glaucoma treatment, the limitations of single-gas strategies constrain their therapeutic efficacy. Here, a photoresponsive dual-gas nanomedicine is developed for targeted glaucoma therapy. The nanomedicine, PdH-D-S, is engineered by synthesizing mesoporous palladium hydride (meso-PdH) with efficient hydrogen (H₂) storage capacity and abundant pore channels, followed by surface modification with DSPE-mPEG and loading sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as a nitric oxide (NO) donor. PdH-D-S penetrates the cornea to reach IOP-regulating tissues, including the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. Upon 808 nm laser excitation, PdH-D-S releases H₂ and NO in a controlled manner. H₂ activates the AKT/p-AKT/eNOS/sGC signaling pathway, while NO binds to soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), converting guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), relaxing trabecular meshwork cells and enhancing aqueous humor outflow. This dual-gas system demonstrates high therapeutic efficacy in lowering IOP and offers a mechanistic advancement in glaucoma treatment through synergistic gas therapy.

Novel management strategies are urgently needed to support coral survival until global efforts can mitigate ocean warming. Given the strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties of molecular hydrogen, our study explores its potential to alleviate the negative effects of heat stress on corals. We investigated the ecophysiological responses of two common hard corals (Acropora sp. and Pocillopora verrucosa) from the Central Red Sea under ambient (26 °C) and elevated seawater temperatures (32 °C), with and without hydrogen addition ( ~ 150 µ M H2) over 48 h. Our results showed that at 32 °C without hydrogen addition, P. verrucosa exhibited high temperature tolerance, whereas Acropora sp. showed significant reductions in photosynthetic efficiency and maximum electron transport rate compared to the ambient condition (26 °C). The addition of hydrogen at 32 °C increased the maximum electron transport rate of Acropora sp. by 28%, maintaining it at levels compared to those at 26 °C. In contrast, the addition of hydrogen at 26 °C caused a significant decrease in the photophysiology of both Acropora sp. and P. verrucosa. This suggests that the short-term response of the coral holobiont to molecular hydrogen is temperature-dependent, potentially benefiting the coral holobiont under heat stress, while impairing the photophysiology under ambient temperatures. Our findings therefore provide the foundation for future long-term studies uncovering the mechanisms behind molecular hydrogen, potentially informing the development of new management strategies to enhance coral resilience to ocean warming.

Here, we report for the first time that recombinant human (Homo sapiens) and pig (Sus scrofa) nuclear prelamin recognition factor (Narf)-like proteins (also known as H. sapiens iron-only hydrogenase-like protein 1 [HsIOP1] and S. scrofa cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly component 3 [SsCIAO3], belonging to the [FeFe]-hydrogenase-like protein family), when expressed in a prokaryotic system, can potentially catalyze H2 production in vitro. Anaerobic induction was clearly observed. Further investigation of the transcriptome database revealed the widespread presence of these proteins in human and pig tissues. Sequence and structural analyses revealed that both HsIOP1 and SsCIAO3 may contain four conserved cysteine residues, forming a [4Fe4S] cluster, similar to the known [FeFe]-hydrogenase in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. According to the observed hydrogenase activities of HsIOP1 and SsCIAO3 produced in Escherichia coli and the ubiquitous presence of Narf-like proteins in eukaryotic organisms, we propose that H2 production may be a universal phenomenon in eukaryotic organisms.

It is widely accepted that PD arises from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, leading to the gradual degeneration of both motor and non-motor systems. Various microbial metabolites and products have been implicated in PD pathology, alongside disruptions to the microbiota–gut–brain axis that are characteristic of the disease. However, the specific gut-derived factors involved in the pathophysiological cascade of PD remain elusive. Hydrogen gas, a recognized component of intestinal microbiota metabolism, has emerged as a potential mediator in the microbiota–gut–brain crosstalk and may represent a missing piece in the PD pathophysiology puzzle [1]. Hydrogen has been shown to selectively neutralize toxic hydroxyl radicals, downregulate proinflammatory factor expression, and preserve cerebrovascular reactivity—key mechanisms implicated in neurodegenerative processes [2]. A deficiency in this neuroprotective gas could negatively impact target tissues, including dopaminergic neurons in PD. Preliminary evidence suggests a reduction in hydrogen-releasing gut bacteria in PD patients [3], but whether this translates to lower hydrogen production or correlates with disease severity remains unclear.

This will provide a theoretical basis for the biosafety of SAEW as a food and drinking water disinfectant. The present study selected and randomly divided 96 4-week-old Kunming mice into three groups: control, 0.5 mg/L SAEW, and 5.0 mg/L SAEW groups. The experiment lasted 60 days. The present study showed that drinking SAEW had no noticeable effect on the food intake, water intake, body weight, and blood biochemical indexes of mice. SAEW significantly increased the plasma superoxide dismutase inhibition rate, glutathione content, and total antioxidant capacity of mice (p < 0.05). The fructose-6-phosphate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase activities of mice in the SAEW group were significantly increased. Furthermore, SAEW promoted the morphological development of the small intestine and increased the activities of amylase, lipase, and protease. Therefore, the 0.5 and 5.0 mg/L SAEW was beneficial for mice, and improved the body's antioxidative, glucose-metabolizing, and digestive ability.

Inflammation and apoptosis of the injured myocardium after revascularization seriously affect the prognosis. Hydrogen possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic effects and may become a new treatment for AMI. This study explored the specific mechanism by which hydrogen operates during AMI treatment. Methods: Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, myocardial infarction (MI), and myocardial infarction + hydrogen (MI+H2), each containing 10 rats. The MI rat model was established by ligation of the left anterior descending branch. The MI+H2 group received 2% hydrogen inhalation treatment for 3 h/Bid. Results: Myocardial infarct size was evaluated using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Transmission electron microscopy showed reduced mitochondrial damage compared with the MI group. JC-1 staining, which indicates mitochondrial membrane potential, showed a low red/green fluorescence intensity ratio in the MI group compared to that in the control group, indicating mitochondrial membrane potential loss. After hydrogen inhalation, this ratio increased, suggesting partial recovery of membrane potential. In addition, mitochondrial ATP content, mitochondrial complex I, and mitochondrial complex III activity were significantly decreased in the MI group, which was improved after hydrogen administration. Western blotting analysis showed decreased Cyt-c protein levels in the myocardial mitochondria and increased levels in the cytoplasm of MI rats. Following hydrogen inhalation, the levels of ROS, 8-OHdG, and MDA that could represent oxidative stress injury significantly decreased. Besides, the expression of Cyt-C, Bax, cleaved-caspase-9, and cleaved-caspase-3 in MI group significantly increased, while the Bcl-2, TRX2, SOD2 expression decreased. The expression of these proteins in MI+H2 group was improved compared with the MI group. Conclusion: Overall, hydrogen inhalation reduces myocardial infarct size, improves mitochondrial dysfunction, and modulates the levels of apoptosis-related substances. Importantly, Hydrogen reduces acute myocardial infarction damage by downregulating ROS and upregulating antioxidant proteins.",Positive,Rat,Heart,Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction),Mitochondrial Function,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,China

Despite its significant impact, effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for POCD are still lacking. Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of POCD. To address this, a H2 emitter is developed that employs hydrogen-gene therapy facilitated by ultrasound, allowing for the repair of the neuroinflammatory microenvironment in a spatiotemporally controllable manner to effectively prevent anesthesia/surgery-induced cognitive impairment. Utilizing focused ultrasound, the blood-brain barrier can be opened in a controlled manner, enabling the efficient delivery of hydrogen emitters (HPPS) carrying siRNA to the site of neuroinflammation. On one hand, the hydrogen emitter effectively generates hydrogen to eliminate excess hydroxyl radicals; on the other hand, it utilizes siRNA to target and reduce tau protein phosphorylation. This targeted hydrogen-gene therapy strategy has been demonstrated in both mouse and rat postoperative models to significantly reduce neuroinflammation and improve postoperative spatial memory as well as object recognition. This study introduces a novel and effective strategy for preventing anesthesia/surgery-induced cognitive impairment and offering new insights for the treatment of other neuroinflammatory diseases.

Here, we present hydrogen (H2) generators-backpacked mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which preserve the biological functions and survival of transplanted cells and reverse articular immune dysfunction, mitigating OA. Specifically, post systemic transplantation, H2 generators-laden MSCs home to OA joints, and upon stimulation in acidic OA environment, H2 produced from the generators remodels articular redox balance, thereby relieving the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreasing cell apoptosis rate, and maintaining pluripotent and paracrine functions of MSCs. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species scavenging by H2 in combination with paracrine effects of the MSCs promote macrophage polarization towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, which contributes to reversing synovial immune disorder. In severe OA model, the backpacked MSCs reduce osteoarthritic degeneration, osteophyte formation and joint inflammation, and promote cartilage regeneration. In sum, our work demonstrates that arming with H2 generators effectively boosts the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, which hold great potential for alleviating redox imbalance-related tissue lesions, including but not limited to OA.

Studies show that molecular hydrogen has neuroprotective effects, such as reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death. It may also protect mitochondria, support cell function, and regulate immune responses, making it a promising new treatment option for SDH. However, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and create treatment guidelines. Case report: We present a 24-year-old man with SDH, along with a right-sided midline shift, uncal herniation, and dilated left pupil. Conventional treatments-craniectomy, hyperbaric oxygen, therapeutic hypothermia, and stem cell therapy-were essential for stabilizing his condition.

While hydrogen has demonstrated potential in reducing oxidative stress and ERS, recent evidence suggests that magnesium may aid in hydrogen release within the body, further enhancing these protective effects. This study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of magnesium in reducing apoptosis and ERS through hydrogen release in a rat model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced HF. Magnesium was administered orally to ISO-induced HF rats, which improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy, and lowered the plasma levels of creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponin-I, and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide precursor in ISO-induced HF rats. It also inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis by upregulating B-cell lymphoma-2, downregulating Bcl-2-associated X protein, and suppressing ERS markers (glucose-related protein 78, activating transcription factor 4, and C/EBP-homologous protein). Magnesium also elevated hydrogen levels in blood, plasma, and cardiac tissue, as well as in artificial gastric juice and pure water, where hydrogen release lasted for at least four hours. Additionally, complementary in vitro experiments were conducted using H9C2 cardiomyocyte injury models, with hydrogen-rich culture medium as the intervention. Hydrogen-rich culture medium improved the survival and proliferation of ISO-treated H9C2 cells, reduced the cell surface area, inhibited apoptosis, and downregulated ERS pathway proteins. However, the protective effects of hydrogen were negated by tunicamycin (an inducer of ERS) in H9C2 cells.

As efficient hydrogen storage nanomaterials, the specific implications of implanted hydrogen on the enzyme-mimicking activity of Pd-based nanomaterials remain largely uninvestigated. In this study, we discovered that hydrogenation process significantly enhances the enzyme-like activity of Pd-based nanomaterials, although reaction specificity varies in dependence on the synthetic route of Pd hydrides. Pd/H2 nanocubes (NCs), which are synthesized by directly injecting hydrogen gas into a solution containing Pd NCs, exhibit a selective enhancement in antioxidative activity against cytotoxic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (O2•-), and hydroxyl radical (•OH) due to the sustained release of bioreductive hydrogen. In contrast, stable Pd hydride NCs, which are prepared through the in situ catalytic decomposition of alternative sources of hydrogen atoms, exhibit a remarkable enhancement in exclusive H2O2 activation pathways, specifically exhibiting peroxidase (POD)-like and catalase (CAT)-like activities. Multiple spectroscopic characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that this high catalytic activity and specificity of PdH NCs arise from lattice tensile strain and electronic structure change. Based on these findings, a PdH/glucose oxidase (GOx) nanocomplex was developed for cascade catalysis in tumor therapy. This work not only reveals that hydride formation can influence both the activity and selectivity of Pd nanozymes but also provides a viable strategy for the precise regulation of specific enzyme-like activity in hydrogen-loading nanozymes.

Chemotherapy has been extensively employed as a postoperative treatment for GBM; however, the produced drug resistance significantly undermines the chemotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, a multifunctional system based on magnesium micromotor (Mg-Motor-DOX) is designed and fabricated that can generate hydrogen gas in situ and actively deliver the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX). Utilizing a temperature-sensitive hydrogel, Mg-Motor-DOX is administrated in situ to the residual cavity of the tumor after subtotal GBM resection.

This study developed a multifunctional hydrogel system by integrating aminoguanidine and hydrogen and oxygen gas-release nanoparticles (PAP NPs) into phenylboronic acid-modified quaternized chitosan and an oxidized dextran network. Hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HPB) nanozymes with superoxide dismutase- and catalase-like activities are promising bioreactors for simultaneously alleviating ROS accumulation and hypoxia by converting elevated endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into oxygen in diabetic wounds. Simultaneously, incorporating ammonia borane (AB)-loaded HPB NPs served as a source of hydrogen, further reducing ROS overproduction and modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Aminoguanidine in the hydrogel network inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), inhibiting skin cell apoptosis and promoting their proliferation and migration. Moreover, the hydrogel exhibited significant mechanical characteristics and self-healing capacity owing to the Schiff base and phenylboronate ester linkages. Incorporating PAP NPs into the hydrogel produced an exceptional photothermal response, effectively eradicating bacteria with a mortality rate exceeding 95 % within 10 min and protecting the wound from potential infections. In vivo studies demonstrated that PAP@Gel significantly accelerated the healing of infected diabetic wounds by mitigating oxidative stress, enhancing oxygenation, inhibiting inflammation and AGE formation, and reversing bacterial infections.

As H2 is one of the major byproducts of inulin fermentation by bacterial species of the gut microbiota (GM), we hypothesized that H2 could mediate the antitumor effects of inulin. To provide evidence in favor of this hypothesis, we first determined the pattern of H2-exposure to which mice are subjected after inulin administration and developed an inhaled hydrogen therapy (H2T) protocol replicating this pattern. We then compared the effects on circulating immunity of a two-week daily inulin gavage with those of the corresponding H2T. We also compared the effects of inulin supplementation to those of the corresponding H2T on implanted melanoma growth and infiltration by T lymphocytes. Inulin and H2T induced a similar increase in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition, both treatments similarly inhibited melanoma tumor growth.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) exerts latent therapeutic means for TBI. Nevertheless, few studies have illustrated the roles of hydrogen combined with needle-embedding therapy (H2 + NET) in TBI and its exact mechanism remains unclear. Here, we elucidated the underlying mechanisms of H2 + NET in the TBI progression. Methods: Controlled cortical impact (CCI) method was conducted to construct TBI mouse model. The mNSS test was used for neurological function measurement. Nissl staining for evaluating neuronal injury, TUNEL assay for determining neuronal apoptosis and ELISA assay was applied for adenosine, ATP level and inflammatory cytokines determination. The relative mRNA levels of inflammatory elements were assessed by qRT-PCR analysis. Iba-1, NLRP3 and STING expression were determined through immunofluorescence staining. The expression of NLRP3 inflammasome related proteins and STING signaling pathway associated proteins were evaluated using Western blot. Results: H2 or NET treatment mitigated brain injury and reduced brain water content in CCI-induced TBI mouse model. CCI induction promoted microglia activation and inflammatory response, thereby activating the NLRP3 inflammasome activity and STING signaling pathway, which was partly reversed by H2 or NET treatment. However, H2 + NET significantly ameliorated brain oedema, and further inhibited inflammatory response, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and STING pathway activation in TBI mice when compared to the H2 or NET alone treatment group.

Hydrogen-rich water (HRW) possesses therapeutic antioxidant properties that may help offer protection to sperm. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of HRW on spermatogenesis dysfunction in rats with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. In this experiment, thirty male Wistar Albino rats were divided into three groups. 1) Control group: fed a normal diet, 2) Obese group: fed a HFD (45 % fat), and 3) HFD + HRW group: fed a high-fat diet and received HRW. HRW (1.5 mM) was administered orally every day. After 16 weeks, blood and tissue samples (testis and epididymis) were collected for biochemical and histopathological analysis. Serum LH, FSH and testosterone and oxidative and antioxidative markers, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total thiol groups were measured in testis and epididymal tissues. The results showed that the HFD significantly increased food intake, body weight, and lee index, all of which were reduced in the HRW-treated obese group. Testis weight, sperm count, Serum LH and histological evaluation of testis including Sertoli and spermatogonia cell counts were significantly lower in the obese group but improved with HRW treatment. Additionally, HRW treatment increased the luminal diameter of seminiferous tubules, epididymal epithelia height, tissue SOD, and total thiol levels, while reducing MDA level in the testis. This study showed that administration of HRW can improve spermatogenesis in obese animals by reducing oxidative stress and ameliorating histological changes in the testis and epididymis, suggesting its potential benefits in combating high-fat diet-induced reproductive dysfunction.

Although gas therapies hold promise for glaucoma treatment, the limitations of single-gas strategies constrain their therapeutic efficacy. Here, a photoresponsive dual-gas nanomedicine is developed for targeted glaucoma therapy. The nanomedicine, PdH-D-S, is engineered by synthesizing mesoporous palladium hydride (meso-PdH) with efficient hydrogen (H₂) storage capacity and abundant pore channels, followed by surface modification with DSPE-mPEG and loading sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as a nitric oxide (NO) donor. PdH-D-S penetrates the cornea to reach IOP-regulating tissues, including the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. Upon 808 nm laser excitation, PdH-D-S releases H₂ and NO in a controlled manner. H₂ activates the AKT/p-AKT/eNOS/sGC signaling pathway, while NO binds to soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), converting guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), relaxing trabecular meshwork cells and enhancing aqueous humor outflow.

Methods: We subjected to controlled cortical impact in mice to construct TBI model. They received an intraperitoneal injection of MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inhibitor, at 10 mg/kg 30 min before TBI. Inhalation of 2% H2 is adopted in TBI mice for 60 min, starting 1 and 6 h post-TBI. 24 h after H2 inhalation, we extracted tissues and analyzed injury related changes. The H2 levels in arterial and venous were tracked after inhalation. Lung tissue was examined for histopathological changes and apoptosis using H&E and TUNEL assays. The total protein in the BALF, oxygenation index, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and lung MPO activity were measured to evaluate the severity of TBI-induced lung injury. Protein and mRNA levels of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-18, and IL-1β in the lung tissue were quantified using western blotting and quantitative PCR. The expression changes and distribution status of NLRP3 and Caspase-1 were examined by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining. Results: Significant lung injury at 24 h post-TBI got significantly reduced by treatment of 2% H2. TBI activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, increasing NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 levels, to lead to higher IL-1β and IL-18 secretion in the lungs.

While hyperammonemia remains the central pathogenic factor in HE progression, emerging evidence implicates oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis as critical synergistic contributors to HE pathogenesis. Hydrogen-rich water, known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, has not been systematically investigated for therapeutic efficacy in HE management. In the current investigation, we successfully established a HE rat model by administering thioacetamide via intraperitoneal injection. By observing the general state and behavioral changes of the rats, detecting liver function and blood ammonia, and observing the pathological changes of liver and brain tissue, it was discussed whether hydrogen-rich water had a preventive and therapeutic effect on hepatic encephalopathy. Oxidative stress, inflammation and neuronal apoptosis were detected in plasma, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus to explore the possible mechanism of its protective effect. The results showed that hydrogen-rich water can improve the behavioral changes of the HE rats, reduce blood ammonia, reduce liver function damage, alleviate the pathological changes of liver and brain tissue, significantly inhibit the systemic and local oxidative stress and inflammation of the brain tissue of the HE rats, and reduce neuronal apoptosis.

This study investigates the effects of hydrogen (H2) administrated via saturated hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in mice received high dose of glucocorticoids (for inducing SAON model). Here we find that HRW treatment significantly reduces osteocyte apoptosis, improves deteriorated trabecular architecture, increases osteoblast numbers and the bone formation, while decreases osteoclast numbers and the bone resorption. Additionally, HRW-treated mice exhibit improved serum lipid profiles, including decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), and total cholesterol (T-CHO), as well as reduced lipid accumulation. HRW treatment also enhances blood perfusion and increases formation of type H vessels in SAON mice. We further demonstrate that HRW shifts the polarization of macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype and suppresses inflammatory marker TNF-α. RNA sequencing data and subsequent validation reveal that HRW upregulates ACOD1 mRNA and protein levels in bone tissues. The protective effects of HRW are mimicked by supplementation with the itaconate derivative dimethyl itaconate in a dose-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of the ACOD1-itaconate pathway in the prevention of SAON by HRW.

Various assessments were performed during HRW intake, such as anthropometric and biochemical measurements, stress, and recovery parameters, as well as biomechanical testing. Results: HRW consumption resulted inan increase in muscle mass and a reduction in fat mass (p < 0.05). However, HRW did not significantly affect stress or recovery rates, as determined by the Recovery-Stress Questionnaire-Sport questionnaire. However, the HRW group exhibited a significant increase in torque, particularly after an intensive exercise test (p < 0.05).

RVH is associated with complex pathological changes, including myocardial cell injury, apoptosis, myocardial fibrosis, neuroendocrine disturbances, and abnormal water and liquid metabolism. Ferroptosis, a novel type of iron-dependent cell death characterized by lipid peroxide accumulation, is an important mechanism of cardiomyocyte death. However, the role of ferroptosis in RVH has rarely been studied. We hypothesize that hydrogen (H2), an experimental medical gas with superior distribution characteristics, inhibits ferroptosis. Aim: To explore the protective effect of H2 on RVH and the mechanism by which H2 regulates ferroptosis. Methods: An in vivo RVH rat model was induced by monocrotaline (MCT) in 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats. An H9C2 cell model was treated with angiotensin II to simulate pressure overload in the RV system in vitro. H2 was administered to rats by inhalation (2% for 3 hours daily for 21 days) and added to the cell culture medium. The Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 (1 μM) was used to investigate anti-ferroptotic mechanisms. Results: In MCT-treated rats, H2 inhalation decreased RVH; the RV wall thickness decreased from 3.5 ± 0.3 mm to 2.8 ± 0.2 mm (P < 0.05) and the RV ejection fraction increased from 45 ± 3% to 52 ± 4% (P < 0.05). In H9C2 cells, H2 alleviated hypertrophy. H2 inhibited ferroptosis by modulating the iron content, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis-related proteins, thereby restoring the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Conclusion: H2 retards RVH by inhibiting ferroptosis via Nrf2/HO-1 restoration, suggesting a new treatment strategy.",Positive,Rat,Heart,Right Ventricular Hypertrophy,Mitochondrial Function,Gas,N/A,Inhalation,,,China

This pilot clinical study aimed to assess the efficacy of hydrogen-rich water treatments in improving objective skin parameters in healthy adults. The hypothesis was that H2, through its selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, would reduce oxidative stress, modulate inflammatory pathways, and enhance skin barrier integrity, leading to measurable improvements in skin appearance. Fifteen participants received topical treatments with hydrogen-rich water for four weeks. Skin parameters, including porphyrin levels, pigmentation irregularities, pore size, wrinkle severity, and biological skin age, were quantitatively assessed before and one week post-treatment. A statistically significant reduction in pore visibility was observed, particularly in younger participants. Although porphyrin levels showed a trend toward reduction, this change was not statistically significant. Improvements were also noted in pigmentation, wrinkle severity, and estimated biological skin age. The treatment was well tolerated, with no adverse effects reported. Despite promising outcomes, this study was limited by the absence of a control group and a relatively short follow-up period. Further controlled studies with larger sample sizes and molecular biomarker analyses are needed to confirm these effects and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. This study addresses a gap in the literature regarding standardized, clinical evaluation of topical H2 application and highlights its potential for utilization in cosmetic and preventive dermatology.

Twenty-seven apparently healthy middle-aged adults (age 57.6 ± 6.7 years; 18 females) voluntarily provided written consent to participate in this randomized, placebo-controlled experimental trial. All participants were allocated in a double-blind parallel-group design to receive either HRW (12 mg of dihydrogen per serving) or control water (<0.1 ppm of dihydrogen) administered two times per day during a 6-week intervention interval. Muscle performance indices showed a significant improvement following both HRW and control water interventions compared to the baseline values (p ≤ 0.05). HRW led to a significant increase in serum free testosterone and cortisol levels, along with reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels at the follow-up (p ≤ 0.05). Moreover, HRW significantly outperformed the control water in reducing biomarkers of acute muscular damage caused by resistance exercise (p ≤ 0.05) and tended to outcompete placebo in improving sleep quality (p = 0.119). HRW could be advanced as a risk-free and effective beverage for promoting training-specific adaptations in exercise-naïve men and women over 50 years of age.

The analgesic and wound healing effects of hydrogen (H2) have gradually been recognized; however, the lack of efficient hydrogen delivery systems remains a major limitation. This study introduces a novel transdermal drug delivery system, which utilizes sustained-release photothermal microneedles (MNs) to ameliorate incisional pain and accelerate wound healing. Polydopamine (PDA)-modified ZIF-8@ammonia borane (AB) nanoparticles with photothermal conversion properties are designed, along with temperature-responsive QX-314-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) microspheres for controlled release, which are delivered in vivo by dissolvable MNs. In vitro results showed that PDA@ZIF-8@AB nanoparticles can release H2 continuously for up to 5 days in an acidic microenvironment, while the photothermal properties of PDA facilitated controlled release of QX-314 through 6 cycles of near-infrared (NIR) exposure. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the MN system provided sustained analgesia for up to 5 days and promoted wound healing in the acidic microenvironment of postoperative incisions. Upon NIR exposure, the photothermal conversion of PDA activated membrane ion channels and induced thermally triggered deformation of PCL@QX-314 microspheres, allowing for on-demand release of QX-314 and targeted neuronal uptake, thus offering personalized analgesia. In vitro cell experiments and in vivo studies confirmed the biocompatibility of the system. This innovative approach not only highlights the dual role of H2 in pain relief and wound healing but also provides a new personalized treatment strategy for postoperative pain management with promising clinical applications.

Hydrogen molecule (H2) is proved as an emerging anti-inflammatory and anti-IRI agent with high biological safety, while local warm heating is well identified and able to improve tissue microcirculation for promoting wound repair. This work proposes a new strategy of visible-photocatalytic hydrogen/warm heat production for combination treatment of PU, and develops palladium nanodots-deposited hydrogen-doped titanium dioxide nanorod (HTON-Pd) as a novel multifunctional photocatalyst, achieving controllable and sustainable visible-photocatalytic production of H2 and heat. Daily administration of the HTON-Pd encapsulated hydrogel dressing (HTON-Pd@Gel) with the assistance of visible light irradiation receives a high outcome of PU treatment. The stubborn PU wound has completely been cured after 11-day treatment with HTON-Pd@Gel. Mechanistically, hydrogen and warm heat photocatalytically produced by HTON-Pd improve the PU wound microenvironment by synergistically promoting the proliferation and migration of skin cells, inhibiting their apoptosis, reducing the inflammatory response, and boosting the generation of new blood vessels in support of PU wound healing.

Regular disinfecting is necessary to maintain a clean toothbrush. Chlorhexidine is the gold standard, but it may be resistant to periodontal pathogens. Hydrogen-rich water, due to its antioxidant properties, may be beneficial against periodontal infections. Method: A study comparing hydrogen water and chlorhexidine as toothbrush disinfectants was conducted. Thirty dental students were divided into two groups: A and B. Group A students used hydrogen water and Group B used chlorhexidine mouth rinse as a disinfecting solution. They were instructed to brush twice a day for seven days and disinfect their toothbrushes with the disinfection solution for 10 minutes. Bristles from the collected toothbrush were sectioned and incubated for 24 hrs and colony-forming units (CFU) were counted. Result: The results showed that hydrogen water had significantly less colony-forming units in brushes disinfected with hydrogen water compared to chlorhexidine. Conclusion: Hydrogen water has better antimicrobial properties than chlorhexidine mouthwash.

Recent research has demonstrated that NEMP can disrupt the male reproductive system. Molecular hydrogen, a selective hydroxyl radical scavenger, has been shown to have the protective effects against many diseases closely associated with oxidative damage. We sought to characterize the beneficial effects of molecular hydrogen on the male reproductive cells. GC-1 spermatogonial cells and TM-3 Leydig cells, two well-established male reproductive cell lines, were exposed to NEMP. Finally, we employed transcriptomic sequencing to explore the transcriptional changes in male reproductive cells induced by NEMP exposure. For the intervention, cells were incubated in hydrogen gas (H2 75%, O2 20%, and CO2 5%) for 1 h. NEMP exposure induced damage to both GC-1 and TM-3 cells, resulting in decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis rates. However, intervention with molecular hydrogen significantly mitigated this damage. Specifically, molecular hydrogen reduced the production of ROS and restored mitochondrial function, thereby alleviating oxidative stress and apoptosis. Transcriptomic sequencing analysis showed that NEMP affected the molecular function term antioxidant activity, particularly Gstp2, a gene predicted to be located in the mitochondria to promote glutathione transferase activity. Hence, molecular hydrogen is a promising protective agent against NEMP in the mechanism that other antioxidants cannot be available.

Patients with severe burns are highly susceptible to the development of postburn sepsis, a condition influenced by multiple factors, such as bacterial infection of the burn wound, alterations in immune status, and excessive release of inflammatory mediators. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which hydrogen gas treatment exerts its effects on postburn sepsis, with a focus on its influence on inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and wound healing. Material and methods: This work employed in vitro assays with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat skin fibroblasts (RSFs) to assess the effects of burn serum and hydrogen gas on cell proliferation through methylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazolium bromide assays and on apoptosis through flow cytometry with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining. In addition, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to quantify inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in fibroblasts treated with burn serum. Western blotting (WB) analysis was conducted to investigate signaling pathway modulation. The severe burn sepsis models of SD rats were segregated into three experimental groups: a healthy normal control group, a burn sepsis control group, and a burn sepsis + hydrogen gas (2%) treatment group. Wound healing was monitored, with wound contraction rates recorded and histological assessments conducted using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining to evaluate tissue repair and collagen deposition. Results: In vitro assays showed that burn serum reduced fibroblast proliferation and increased apoptosis (P < 0.01), which hydrogen gas mitigated by rescuing cell viability and reducing apoptosis (P < 0.01). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed burn serum-induced increases in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers, with decreases in antioxidant enzymes (P < 0.01), which hydrogen gas reversed (P < 0.05). WB analysis suggested hydrogen gas's anti-inflammatory and proliferative effects by modulating signaling pathways (P < 0.01). In vivo, hydrogen gas treatment considerably improved wound healing, with accelerated contraction and enhanced collagen deposition. Plasma and skin tissue analyses indicated systemic and local anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects from hydrogen gas. Conclusion: Hydrogen gas treatment demonstrates potential therapeutic efficacy in the management of postburn sepsis by modulating inflammatory responses, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting wound healing.
