Herein, it is demonstrated that the surface corrosion of a conventional Ni foam electrode in the presence of Fe3+ and V3+ cations can transform it into an electrode with a high catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The corroded electrode consists of a ternary NiFeV layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet array supported on the Ni foam surface. This NiFeV LDH electrode achieves an OER current density of 100 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 272 mV in 1 m KOH, outperforming the IrO2 catalyst by 180 mV. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unique structure and the presence of vanadium in NiFeV LDH play a key role in achieving improved OER activity. When coupled with a commercial Pt/C cathode catalyst, the resulting AEM water electrolyzer achieves a cell current density as high as 2.1 A cm-2 at a voltage of only 1.8 Vcell in 1 m KOH, which is similar to the performance of the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer obtained from the IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts pair.

Hydrogen is considered an ideal solution as it can be produced electrochemically by water electrolysis and renewably while no pollutants are released when consumed. The most common catalysts in electrolyzers are composed of rare and expensive precious group metals. Replacing these materials with Earth-abundant materials is important to make these devices economically viable. Metal organic frameworks are one possible solution. Herein we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization studies of metal benzene-tri-carboxylic acid-based metal-organic frameworks embedded in activated carbon. The conductive composite material was found to be electrocatalytically active for both the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, several metal organic frameworks sharing the same ligand but with different first-row transition metals (M = Co, Cu, Fe, Mn) were compared, and the trend of their activity is discussed. Cobalt was found to have the highest activity among the studied metal centers, and therefore has the best potential to serve as a bifunctional catalyst for alkaline electrolyzers. ",Israel

A key challenge is the efficient production of hydrogen to meet the commercial-scale demand of hydrogen. Water splitting electrolysis is a promising pathway to achieve the efficient hydrogen production in terms of energy conversion and storage in which catalysis or electrocatalysis plays a critical role. The development of active, stable, and low-cost catalysts or electrocatalysts is an essential prerequisite for achieving the desired electrocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting for practical use, which constitutes the central focus of this review. It will start with an introduction of the water splitting performance evaluation of various electrocatalysts in terms of activity, stability, and efficiency. This will be followed by outlining current knowledge on the two half-cell reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in terms of reaction mechanisms in alkaline and acidic media. Recent advances in the design and preparation of nanostructured noble-metal and non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts will be discussed. New strategies and insights in exploring the synergistic structure, morphology, composition, and active sites of the nanostructured electrocatalysts for increasing the electrocatalytic activity and stability in HER and OER will be highlighted.

When electrolysis was performed for 10 minutes using a direct-current electrolytic hydrogen-water generating bottle with tap water, 'residual free chlorine' concurrently upon the production of molecular hydrogen (444 μg/L) could be appreciably decreased from 0.18 mg/L to 0.12 mg/L as quantified by a N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine-dye colorimetric method. Moreover, the total chlorine concentration (residual bound chlorine plus free chlorine) was estimated to be decreased from 0.17 mg/L to 0.11 mg/L. Although a merit of electrolytic hydrogen-generating bottles exists in electrolysis for periods as short as 10 minutes, the 30-minute electrolysis brought about the more abundant hydrogen (479 μg/L) together with an oxidation-reduction potential of -245 mV; even upon this long-term electrolysis, the gross amounts of chlorine, hypochlorous acid and chloramine were shown not to be increased (0.09-0.10 mg/L from 0.11 mg/L for tap water) as detected by orthotolidine colorimetry. Above-mentioned levels of diverse-type chlorines might fulfill the World Health Organization guideline for drinking water below 5 mg/L. In addition, the dissolved ozone upon electrolytic generation of hydrogen-water was below the detection limit (< 0.05 mg/L) or undetectable, which fulfilled the official safety standards in Japan and the USA for drinking water below 0.1 mg/L, as evaluated by three methods such as an electrode-type ozone checker, indigo dye-utilizing ozone detector capillaries and potassium iodide-based colorimetry. Importantly, even when half the amount of tap water was poured into the tank of the apparatus and electrolyzed, both the residual chlorine and ozone concentrations measured were also below the safety standard. Thus, major potently harmful substances, such as residual free/bound chlorine, or hypochlorous-acid/chloramine, respectively, and dissolved ozone, as the drinking hydrogen-water was direct-current-electrolytically generated, were estimated to be repressed within safety concentration ranges with achievements of abundant hydrogen generation.

Using ion transport membranes to prevent the migration of oxygen (O2) from the anode to the cathode, the purity of H2 can be increased to ∼99.8%, but it still cannot fulfill the requirement for use in fuel cells (>99.97%). Here, we report that modifying a commercial ionic membrane (Nafion) with carbon dots (CDs) can further inhibit O2 permeation across the membrane, while effectively improving its ion transportability. The key to achieve these effects is the rational design and proper loading of the CDs, which narrows the pore size of the membrane from ∼4 nm to <2 nm and alters its surface functionality. Using the CDs-modified Nafion membrane in an H-type electrolysis cell, we demonstrate that H2 with a purity of up to 99.98%, which meets the standards of hydrogen fuel cells, can be directly produced without any additional purification process. Our study provides a new route for the low-cost electrolysis of water to produce high-purity hydrogen. ",China

Hydrogen is a potential non-carbon-based energy source, which is gradually replacing the dependency on fossil fuels. It is anticipated that as the alternative fuel since hydrogen can be produced from green and clean sources. The evolution of hydrogen from renewable and non-renewable sources by various technologies has now gained tremendous research and industrial interest. The most appropriate methods for hydrogen generation involve the direct conversion of solar energy, exploitation of solar and wind energy for the electrolysis of water, besides conversion of fuel and biomass. To produce cleaner hydrogen and its separation from the chemical impurities is crucial and several methods including photobiological, photoelectrochemical, electrochemical, photocatalytic, thermochemical, thermolysis, and steam gasification have been used. The diverse types of membranes along with the pressure gas swing adsorption technique is another technique used to separate hydrogen, but the storage of hydrogen in an inexpensive, safe, compact, and environmentally friendly manner is one of the major concerns contributing to the country's economy. Apart from the countless advantages, storage and handling of hydrogen is a serious concern. Owing to its high inflammability, enough safety measures should be adopted during its production and storage as a fuel. It is necessary to provide information regarding the production technologies, storage, and separation methods of hydrogen and the present review addresses these issues. ",India

Although electrocatalytic water splitting has been proposed for decades, large-scale industrial hydrogen production is hindered by high electricity cost, capital investment, and electrolysis media. Harsh conditions (strong acid/alkaline) are widely used in electrocatalytic mechanism studies, and excellent catalytic activities and efficiencies have been achieved. However, the practical application of electrocatalytic water splitting in harsh conditions encounters several obstacles, such as corrosion issues, catalyst stability, and membrane technical difficulties. Thus, the research on water splitting in mild conditions (neutral/near neutral), even in natural seawater, has aroused increasing attention.

The through-plane and in-plane electronic conductivities were also measured using two- and four-probe methods, respectively.

Type I is a monolayered Pt top-coated type, in which the thickness of the top-coated Pt layer is approximately 100 nm; Type II is a few-layered type with a top-coated Pt layer thickness of approximately 200 nm, and Type III is a multilayered type with a top-coated Pt layer thickness of approximately 750 nm.

The relationship between the applied H2 content in the gaseous mixture and the H2 concentration value at equilibrium is linear. At the same time, the hydrogen monitoring system has a rather long response time, and its readings seem to slightly diverge from sensor to sensor as well as at different temperatures. For this reason, a sensor recalibration might be necessary, which could become part of the product's ongoing development. Nevertheless, the aforementioned minor deficiencies can be mostly considered negligible in applications such as haemodialysis. ",Germany

However, both have major drawbacks. A-WE shows low productivity and efficiency, while PEM-WE uses a significant amount of critical raw materials. Lately, the use of anion-exchange membrane electrolyzers (AEM-WE) has been proposed to overcome the limitations of the current commercial systems. AEM-WE could become the cornerstone to achieve an intense, safe and resilient green hydrogen production to fulfill the hydrogen targets to achieve the 2050 decarbonization goals.

Among the many possible approaches, convenient and safe hydrogen production from water electrolysis has always been a preferred in‐situ hydrogen supply technology. So far, many of the electrodes thus involved are based on rigid metals or conductive items which may encounter inconvenience or insufficiency sometimes. In order to achieve targeted release of hydrogen, appropriate administration of suitable flexible hydrogen evolution electrodes is the key. In recent years, gallium‐based liquid metals have emerged in the field of flexible and biological electrodes. Starting from this point, liquid metal is proposed here as a transformable amorphous electrode for hydrogen evolution in electrolytic water which may help mold new conceptual electrolysis and energy utilization ways. The electrochemical performances and flexible behaviors lying behind are investigated and clarified. According to the experiments, the catalytic activity of the liquid metal itself generally is not remarkable, but it would be significantly improved after being composited with certain active materials such as nickel. Further, the controllability, flexibility, and adaptability of liquid metal‐based amorphous materials which are unmatched by other electrode materials were evaluated. Overall, the motions of such shape transformable liquid metal electrodes could be controlled by electric or magnetic fields, and their deformations are compliantly adaptive to different spaces. This might easily expand the area of hydrogen evolution and lead to multi‐site in‐situ hydrogen production. The present study demonstrates the value of liquid metals in flexible energy systems and opens up more application possibilities for the electrolytic hydrogen production.

We evaluated the abilities of these aqueous solutions to inhibit the oxidation of biomolecules catalyzed by an enzyme and induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also to scavenge ROS directly using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry. The concentrations of inorganic elements including Ge and Pt were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). All the water products examined more or less inhibited the oxidation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine by tyrosinase and that of L-histidine in an L-ascorbic acid/Cu2+ reaction system.

"Yurt, Bayram",,,Effect of Hydrogen-Enriched Solvents on the Extraction of Phytochemicals in Propolis ,2023,ACS Omega,10.1021/acsomega.3c01673 ,"Propolis, one of the most important bee products, cannot be used in its raw form. The efficiency of the bioactive components of propolis increases with the extraction process. The choice of solvent to be used in the extraction of propolis is effective in determining the properties of the extract. Ethanol is the most widely used solvent, which significantly increases the efficiency of its bioactive components in the extraction of propolis. Effective nonalcohol-based extraction techniques have become important since alcohol-based extracts cause some discomfort and cannot be used in people with alcohol intolerance. The use of water in propolis extraction is less preferred than ethanol because it does not thoroughly dissolve the bioactive components. In this study, the effect of incorporating hydrogen into solvents (water, ethanol, and methanol) on the extraction of total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, antioxidant activities, and phenolic compound profile of the propolis sample was evaluated. Incorporation of H2 into water, ethanol, and methanol led to an increase in total phenolic content by 19.08, 5.43, and 12.71% and in the total flavonoid content by 28.97, 17.13, and 2.06%, respectively. Besides, the highest increases in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) scavenging activities were observed in hydrogen-rich water (4.4%) and hydrogen-rich ethanol (32.4%) compared to their counterparts, respectively. On the other hand, incorporation of H2 into different solvents led to significant increases in different phenolics, and it was observed that the level of change was dependent on the type of the phenolic compound and the solvent used. This study is important in terms of using hydrogen-enriched solvents to extract phenolics from propolis for the first time. Using hydrogen-rich solvents, specifically hydrogen-rich water, was observed to be an effective method for the improvement of phytochemical extraction efficiency in propolis. ",Turkey

Based on the energy and mechanical analyses of nano and microbubbles, the hydrogen bubble generation mechanism and the effect of temperature on bubble parameters during the evolution process when the ultrasonic field is coupled with the electric field are investigated. The nucleation frequency of the hydrogen bubbles, the relationship between the pressure and temperature and the operating temperature during the generation and detachment of bubbles as well as the detachment radius of bubbles under the action of the ultrasonic field are obtained. The effects of ultrasound and temperature on hydrogen production were verified by visual experiments. The results show that the operating temperature affects the nucleation, growth, and detachment processes of hydrogen bubbles. The effect of temperature on the nucleation frequency of bubbles mainly comes from the Gibbs free energy required for the electrolysis reaction. The bubble radius and growth rate are both related to the temperature to the power of one-third. Ultrasonic waves enhance the separation of hydrogen bubbles from the catalyst surface by acoustic cavitation and impact effects. An increase in the working temperature reduces the activation energy barriers to be overcome for the electrolysis reaction of water, which together with a decrease in the Gibbs free energy and the surface tension coefficient, leads to an increase in the nucleation frequency of the catalytic layer and a decrease in the radius of bubble detachment, and thus improves the hydrogen precipitation performance. Visualization experiments show that in actual PEM hydrogen production, ultrasonic intensification can promote the formation of nucleation sites. The ultrasonic induced fine bubble flow not only has a drag effect on the bubble, but also intensifies the polymerization growth of the bubble due to the impact of the fine bubble flow, thus speeding up the detachment of the bubble, shortening the covering time of the hydrogen bubble on the surface of the catalytic electrode, reducing the activation voltage loss and improve the hydrogen production efficiency of PEM. The experimental results show that when the electrolyte is 60°C, the maximum hydrogen production efficiency of ultrasound is increased by 7.34%, and the average hydrogen production efficiency is increased by 5.83%.

In this study, the effects of molecular hydrogen (H2) on the activity and structural characteristics of HRP were investigated by employing multiple spectroscopic techniques, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results demonstrated that H2 could enhance HRP activity, especially in 1.5 mg/L hydrogen-rich water (HRW). The structural analysis results showed that H2 might alter HRP activity by affecting the active sites, secondary structure, hydrogen bonding network, CS groups, and morphological characteristics. The MD results also confirmed that H2 could increase the FeN bond distance in the active site, affect the secondary structure, and increase the number of hydrogen bonds. The MD results further suggested that H2 could increase the number of salt bridges, and lengthen the SS bonds in HRP. This study primarily revealed the mechanism by which H2 enhances the HRP activity, providing insight into the interactions between gas and macromolecular proteins. However, some of the results obtained via MD simulations still need to be verified experimentally. In addition, our study also provided a new convenient strategy to enhance enzyme activity. ",China

NBs are gas-filled pockets suspended as sphere-like cavities (bulk NBs) or attached to surfaces (surface NBs) with diameters of <1 μm. Compared to macro bubbles and microbubbles, NBs have demonstrated unique characteristics such as long residence time in water, higher gas mass transfer efficiency and hydroxyl radical production. This paper focuses on reviewing NB technology in aquaculture systems by summarizing and discussing uses and implications. Three focus areas were targeted to review the applicability and effects of NBs in aquaculture: (i) NBs aeration to improve the aquaculture harvest yield and subsequent wastewater treatment; (ii) NB application for inactivation of harmful microorganisms; and (iii) NBs for reducing oxidative stress and improving animal health. Thus, this study reviews the research studies published in the last 10 years in which air, oxygen, ozone, and hydrogen NBs were tested to improve gas mass transfer, wastewater treatment and control of pathogenic microorganisms.

However, studies regarding the optimal concentration of hydrogen and the associated mechanisms of action in organisms are lacking. This study showed that the maximum germination rate of radish seeds decreased from 90 % to 50 % under the stress of cadmium ions (Cd2+), and hydrogen nanobubble (NB) water significantly alleviated the stress effect of Cd2+ on radish seed germination. A hydrogen concentration of 0.8 ppm had the best effect, reducing Cd2+ accumulation in radish seeds by 63.23 % and increasing the maximum germination rate from 50 % to 65 %. At concentrations exceeding 1.2 ppm, the beneficial effect of hydrogen was weakened or even reversed. Consequently, we integrated the concept of the oxidative window into a REDOX balance model and demonstrated that an appropriate hydrogen concentration can effectively maintain the REDOX state within organisms.

To address the key technical challenge of low-efficiency oxidation-reduction reactions for narrow-bandgap photocatalytic materials, this work proposes an innovative approach for the controllable fabrication of multiphoton photocatalytic materials to overcome the limitations imposed by traditional near-infrared photocatalysts with ""narrow-bandgap"" constraints. Herein, an NIR-responsive multiphoton photocatalyst, ZrTc-Co, is developed by utilizing a post-synthetic coordination modification strategy to introduce hydrogenation active site CoII into a multiphoton responsive MOF (ZrTc). The results reveal that with the introduction of the CoII site, electron-hole recombination can be efficiently suppressed, thus promoting the efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, the integration of CoII can effectively enhance charge transfer and improve static hyperpolarizability, which endows ZrTc-Co with excellent multiphoton absorption. Moreover, hyaluronic acid modification endows ZrTc-Co with cancer cell-specific targeting characteristics, laying the foundation for tumor-specific elimination.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply hydrogen-infused water to starch modification. The surface of HMT-modified samples was much rougher than that of native QS. HMT did not change the typical ""A""-type X-ray diffraction pattern of QS but it increased its relative crystallinity. Meanwhile, amylose content, gelatinization temperature and water absorption capacity of QS significantly increased, whereas viscosity and swelling power markedly decreased. The rapidly digestible starch level of HMT-treated samples was significantly lower than that of native QS, and the resistant starch content markedly increased. These alterations were dependent on treatment moisture level. Furthermore, compared to distilled water, the HMT with hydrogen-infused and plasma-activated waters induced much more extensive effect on above properties, and the sample treated with plasma-activated water had the highest extent due to the acidic or alkaline environment and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. These results identified that the combination of HMT with hydrogen-infused or plasma-activated water was a novel strategy to improve the thermal stability and functionality of quinoa starch. ",China

We observe bubbles without (""pinned bubbles"") and with (""spreading bubbles"") contact line spreading and find that the latter mode becomes more prevalent if the concentration of HClO4 is ≥0.1 M. The departure radius for spreading bubbles is found to drastically exceed the value predicted by the well-known formula of W. Fritz [Phys. Z. 1935, 36, 379-384] for this case. We show that this is related to the contact line hysteresis, which leads to pinning of the contact line after an initial spreading phase at the receding contact angle. The departure mode is then similar to a pinned bubble and occurs once the contact angle reaches the advancing contact angle of the surface. A prediction for the departure radius based on these findings is found to be consistent with the experimental data. ",Netherlands

This work uncovers the pivotal role of the nanoelectrode shape in influencing catalytic performance and nanobubble detachment. Using molecular dynamics simulations supported by experimental evidence, we establish that nanoparticle electrodes with convex geometries (e.g., hemispheres, spheres, and cubes) sustain higher catalytic performance by maintaining greater reactive surface exposure than flat or concave electrodes. Most importantly, we demonstrate that convex nanoparticle electrodes mitigate bubble pinning by promoting unlimited growth and spontaneous detachment. We develop a diffusional theory that explains and generalizes our simulations, predicting the onset currents that drive nanobubbles into a nonstationary growth regime. This theory reveals that the transition to continuous bubble growth occurs when the electrochemically generated gas rate surpasses the diffusion-limited escape rate, independent of electrode size and convex shape but sensitive to the electrode support. The theoretical model extends the predictions to other gas-evolving electrochemical processes, highlighting its relevance to diverse catalytic systems. Surprisingly, our calculations reveal that bubble detachment contributes minimally to the total current. Instead, the enhanced catalytic efficiency of convex electrodes stems from their ability to sustain an exposed reactive surface, even during bubble growth. These findings provide a fundamental framework for designing nanoelectrodes that optimize gas evolution by prioritizing surface exposure rather than relying solely on bubble detachment.

These effects are often either overstated or completely neglected in the literature, which complicates the accurate analysis of experimental results for gas evolution reactions. This study systematically identifies and quantifies the overpotential losses induced by bubbles by combining experimental results for hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER), obtained using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique, with simulations based on a two-dimensional transmission line model. Our results show that ohmic overpotential is the primary cause of apparent activity loss due to bubbles in RDE. This effect leads to catalyst activity misestimates exceeding 2 orders of magnitude, and Tafel slope errors of 100% at higher currents if left uncorrected. By identifying these effects, this work provides a robust framework for mitigating inaccuracies and improving the characterization of electrocatalysts for gas evolution reactions. ",Slovenia

However, their stabilization mechanisms in different solvents remain not fully understood. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the stability and evolution of bulk hydrogen NBs in water and methanol, with experimental measurements providing validation. The results show that NBs in methanol tend to dissolve at lower initial gas densities, indicating a lower stability compared to those in water. Under stable conditions, approximately 80% of hydrogen molecules remain inside NBs in water, while only about 40% remain in methanol, consistent with methanol's higher hydrogen solubility observed experimentally. Further analysis reveals that hydrogen NBs in water exhibit a thinner gas-liquid interface as well as lower internal pressure and gas density, mainly related to its lower hydrogen solubility. Utilizing mechanical equilibrium and critical radius theory, we identify the hydrogen concentration thresholds for NB stability to be 0.96-1.44 mol/L in water and 2.69-2.88 mol/L in methanol. Additionally, hydrogen molecules in methanol exhibit more vigorous motion, stronger gas-liquid interactions, and a weaker hydrogen bond network. This study provides molecular-level insights into the stabilization of bulk hydrogen NBs in different solvents. ",China

Herein, we designed a customized electrolytic cell with separated cathode and anode chambers to enable the independent production of hydrogen bulk nanobubbles (H2-BNBs) and oxygen bulk nanobubbles (O2-BNBs). Notably, the introduction of ultrasonic waves during water electrolysis resulted in an approximately six-fold increase in H2-BNBs concentration compared to conventional electrolysis. Systematic investigations were conducted to elucidate the effects of key parameters, including ultrasonic-electrolysis duration, applied voltage, electrolyte type, and electrolyte concentration. Under optimized electrochemical conditions, stable H2-BNBs with a number concentration of ∼ 2.0 × 108 particles mL-1 were achieved. Furthermore, H2-BNBs exhibited superior stability in alkaline solutions compared to acidic environments, maintaining a long lifetime for over 24 h. This study established a robust methodology for the scalable production of H2-BNBs, offering strategic implications for their utilization in diverse industrial and scientific domains. ",China

Microbial biodegradation plays a crucial role in OMP-elimination from drinking water resources. However, long-term OMP-biodegradation remains challenging since the metabolic activity of degrading strains is restricted by energy-limited conditions in treatment systems. Molecular hydrogen (H2) has been identified as a universally available energy source utilized by various bacteria under nutrient-starved conditions, and it can be hypothesized that H2 might also support OMP-degrading microbes when other energy carriers are scarce. The potential of H2 as a supporting energy source for OMP-degradation was tested by examining its effect on the biodegradation of 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) by Aminobacter niigataensis MSH1 and on the physiological status of the MSH1 cells during both nongrowth-linked (500 μg BAM/L) and growth-linked (10,000 μg BAM/L) regimes. MSH1 cells used as inoculum were either not or pre-exposed to H2 and were harvested at different growth phases. During the nongrowth-linked BAM biodegradation, MSH1 pre-exposed to H2 exhibited a 1.2 to 1.5-fold higher initial specific BAM biodegradation rate, resulting in more rapid BAM removal, likely due to the retention of more metabolically active cells, as suggested by a cell vitality assay. During the growth-linked biodegradation, MSH1 pre-exposed to H2 demonstrated accelerated growth with a 1.5-fold higher maximum specific growth rate, which coincided with an improved BAM removal. The positive effects of H2 were only evident for MSH1 cells harvested either at the stationary and/or starvation phase. Evidence of H2 metabolism was supported by H₂ consumption measurements. Collectively, this study reveals that microbial H2 metabolism enables OMP-degrading bacteria to sustain metabolic activity under starvation conditions, offering a novel strategy to enhance long-term OMP-biodegradation.

Importantly, the anode and cathode are additively manufactured using filaments of Inconel-625 (I-AME) via fused filament fabrication. The I-AMEs exhibit efficient electrocatalysis toward major reactions within water electrolyzer devices, namely, the hydrogen evolution reaction on the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction on the anode, in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The I-AMEs exhibit excellent stability with no decline in their electrochemical signal output during an 80 h chronoamperometry procedure and 192 h of submersion in 0.5 M H2SO4. Key insights into the effect of electrode design and architecture within flow devices are presented with computational fluid dynamic modeling revealing optimal electrode designs to maximize electrode-electrolyte interaction. The additively manufactured electrolyzer device was shown to be capable of producing 100.8 mL/h and 36 mL/h of hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, at a low current density of ca. 5 mA cm-2. The herein described additive manufactured water electrolyzer device has the potential to produce significant quantities of hydrogen and oxygen gas in remote scenarios without the requirement of complex and costly technologies.
