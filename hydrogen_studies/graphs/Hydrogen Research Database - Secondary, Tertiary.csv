It is proposed that molecular hydrogen, produced in quite large amounts as a by-product of colonic fermentation of dietary fibre and unabsorbed carbohydrate may play an important role. Hydrogen in the tissues may act as a powerful reducing agent (antioxidant) of potentially damaging free radical species (e.g. singlet oxygen) and in so doing, along with other antioxidants would help in the control of these potentially damaging species and their known involvement in disease causation.

Anaerobic Clostridia are potential producers and immobilized C. butyricum produces 2 mol H2/mol glucose at 50% efficiency. Spontaneous production of H2 from formate and glucose by immobilized Escherichia coli showed 100% and 60% efficiencies, respectively. Enterobactericiae produces H2 at similar efficiency from different mono-saccharides during growth. Among methylotrophs, methanogenes, rumen bacteria, and thermophilic archae, Ruminococcus albus, is promising (2.37 mol/mol glucose). Immobilized aerobic Bacillus licheniformis optimally produces 0.7 mol H2/mol glucose. Photosynthetic Rhodospirillum rubrum produces 4, 7, and 6 mol of H2 from acetate, succinate, and malate, respectively. Excellent productivity (6.2 mol H2/mol glucose) by co-cultures of Cellulomonas with a hydrogenase uptake (Hup) mutant of R. capsulata on cellulose was found. Cyanobacteria, viz., Anabaena, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria sp., have been studied for photoproduction of H2. Immobilized A. cylindrica produces H2 (20 ml/g dry wt/h) continually for 1 year. Increased H2 productivity was found for Hup-mutant of A. variabilis. Synechococcus sp. has a high potential for H2 production in fermentors and outdoor cultures. Simultaneous productions of oxychemicals and H2 by Klebseilla sp. and by enzymatic methods were also attempted. The fate of H2 biotechnology is presumed to be dictated by the stock of fossil fuel and state of pollution in future.",Review,Hydrogen Biology,India

Chronically ill and incurable people have been pilgrimaging there for 6 years (a few hundred daily). The average age of the test-subjects was 66, the length of stay was 6 days (taking 2 tunnelwalks at 30 min. each and consuming 2 litres of water daily). The spring water was seen as a possible active substance, as it possesses the quality of “reduced water” (triple analysis in the Laboratory of Cellular Regulation Technology Kyushu University, Japan). In order to record a picture of the symptoms, a list of complaints based on a complaint questionnaire (Hock. K. and Hess, H., Berlin 1975) was modified and presented in form of a rating-scale in 10 steps. The test-subjects had a choice of 47 different statements to describe the current experienced extent of their respective symptom at the beginning of their stay (Measure Point MP1), at the end of their stay MP2 and after three months MP3, divided into steps of intensity. The most important point concerning the evaluation of this survey is the following: at no time were the examinees asked if they had felt any improvement or deterioration in their condition. Furthermore, it was technically impossible for the testees to draw comparisons between the three test results as they had no access to previous pathological findings. Consequently the examinees had no point of orientation to set the placebo mechanism in motion.",Review,Oxidative Stress/General Health,Germany

The resulting proto-eukaryotic cell would have acquired the essentials of eukaryotic energy metabolism, evolving not only aerobic respiration, but also the cost of oxygen consumption, i.e., generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage. Mitochondria contain their own genome with a modified genetic code that is highly conserved among mammals. Control of gene expression suggests that transcription of certain mitochondrial genes may be regulated in response to the redox potential of the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria are involved in energy production and conservation, and they have an uncoupling mechanism to produce heat instead of ATP. Also, mitochondria are involved in programmed cell death. Increasing evidence suggests the participation of mitochondria in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases involving alterations in both nuclear (nDNA) and mitochondrial (mtDNA) DNA. Melatonin is now known as a powerful antioxidant and increasing experimental evidence shows its beneficial effects against oxidative stress-induced macromolecular damage and diseases, including those in which mitochondrial function is affected. This review summarizes the data and mechanisms of action of melatonin in relation to mitochondrial pathologies. ",Review,Mitochondrial Health,Spain

Weak current produces only active hydrogen and hydrogen molecule without production of oxygen molecule. Active hydrogen is so small that almost all minerals adsorbs or absorbs it. These facts prompted us to propose “active hydrogen theory of reduced water”. We have demonstrated that electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) and ground waters such as Hita Tenryosui water in Japan, Nordenau water in Germany, Tracote water in Mexico, which are so called miracle water because of their improving activity on various diseases, are all antioxidative water containing active hydrogen and can scavenge intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reduced water stimulated glucose uptake into muscle and adipocyte cells as well as insulin. It also stimulated the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells and improved the sugar tolerance damage in type 2 diabetes model mice. Reduced water impaired the tumor phenotypes such as rapid growth, anchorage independent growth in a soft agar, morphology, telomere maintenance, and abilities of invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. It activated the cancer immune systems, suppressing the tumor growth in vivo. Reduced water is expected for utilization for prevention and therapy of various diseases.",Review,Oxidative Stress/General Health,Japan

Food safety must be ensured at each postharvest processing step, including handling, washing of raw materials, cleaning of utensils and pipelines, and packaging. Several commercial products are available for this purpose. The time is ripe for developing new techniques and technologies. The use of electrolyzed water (EW) is the product of a new concept developed in Japan, which is now gaining popularity in other countries. Little is known about the principle behind its sterilizing e#ect, but it has been shown to have significant bactericidal and virucidal and moderate fungicidal properties. Some studies have been carried out in Japan, China, and the USA on the pre-and postharvest application of EW in the field of food processing. EW may be produced using common salt and an apparatus connected to a power source. As the size of the machine is quite small, the water can be manufactured on-site. Studies have been carried out on the use of EW as a sanitizer for fruits, utensils, and cutting boards. It can also be used as a fungicide during postharvest processing of fruits and vegetables, and as a sanitizer for washing the carcasses of meat and poultry.

"Vorobjeva, N.V.",,,Selective stimulation of the growth of anaerobic microflora in the human intestinal tract by electrolyzed reducing water ,2005,Medical Hypotheses,10.1016/j.mehy.2004.07.038 ,"96-99% of the 'friendly' or residential microflora of intestinal tract of humans consists of strict anaerobes and only 1-4% of aerobes. Many diseases of the intestine are due to a disturbance in the balance of the microorganisms inhabiting the gut. The treatment of such diseases involves the restoration of the quantity and/or balance of residential microflora in the intestinal tract. It is known that aerobes and anaerobes grow at different oxidation-reduction potentials (ORP). The former require positive E(h) values up to +400 mV. Anaerobes do not grow unless the E(h) value is negative between -300 and -400 mV. In this work, it is suggested that prerequisite for the recovery and maintenance of obligatory anaerobic microflora in the intestinal tract is a negative ORP value of the intestinal milieu. Electrolyzed reducing water with E(h) values between 0 and -300 mV produced in electrolysis devices possesses this property. Drinking such water favours the growth of residential microflora in the gut. A sufficient array of data confirms this idea. However, most researchers explain the mechanism of its action by an antioxidant properties destined to detox the oxidants in the gut and other host tissues. Evidence is presented in favour of the hypothesis that the primary target for electrolyzed reducing water is the residential microflora in the gut. ",Hypothesis,Hydrogen Biology,Russia

By electrolysis, a dilute sodium chloride solution dissociates into acidic electrolyzed water (AEW), which has a pH of 2 to 3, an oxidation-reduction potential of >1,100 mV, and an active chlorine content of 10 to 90 ppm, and basic electrolyzed water (BEW), which has a pH of 10 to 13 and an oxidation-reduction potential of -800 to -900 mV. Vegetative cells of various bacteria in suspension were generally reduced by > 6.0 log CFU/ml when AEW was used. However, AEW is a less effective bactericide on utensils, surfaces, and food products because of factors such as surface type and the presence of organic matter. Reductions of bacteria on surfaces and utensils or vegetables and fruits mainly ranged from about 2.0 to 6.0 or 1.0 to 3.5 orders of magnitude, respectively. Higher reductions were obtained for tomatoes. For chicken carcasses, pork, and fish, reductions ranged from about 0.8 to 3.0, 1.0 to 1.8, and 0.4 to 2.8 orders of magnitude, respectively. Considerable reductions were achieved with AEW on eggs. On some food commodities, treatment with BEW followed by AEW produced higher reductions than did treatment with AEW only. EW technology deserves consideration when discussing industrial sanitization of equipment and decontamination of food products. Nevertheless, decontamination treatments for food products always should be considered part of an integral food safety system. Such treatments cannot replace strict adherence to good manufacturing and hygiene practices. ",Review,Disinfection/Sterilization,Switzerland

The 'hydrogen hypothesis' invokes metabolic symbiosis as the driving force for a symbiotic association between an anaerobic, strictly hydrogen-dependent (the host) and an eubacterium (the symbiont) that was able to respire, but which generated molecular hydrogen as an end product of anaerobic metabolism. The resulting proto-eukaryotic cell would have acquired the essentials of eukaryotic energy metabolism, evolving not only aerobic respiration, but also the physiological cost of the oxygen consumption, i.e., generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the associated oxidative damage. This is not the only price to pay for respiring oxygen: mitochondria possess nitric oxide (NO·) for regulatory purposes but, in some instances it may react with superoxide anion radical to produce the toxic reactive nitrogen species (RNS), i.e. peroxynitrite anion, and the subsequent nitrosative damage. New mitochondria contain their own genome with a modified genetic code that is highly conserved among mammals. The transcription of certain mitochondrial genes may depend on the redox potential of the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria are related to the life and death of cells. They are involved in energy production and conservation, having an uncoupling mechanism to produce heat instead of ATP, but they are also involved in programmed cell death. Increasing evidence suggest the participation of mitochondria in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases involving alterations in both nuclear (nDNA) and mitochondrial (mtDNA) DNA. Melatonin is a known powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and increasing experimental and clinical evidence shows its beneficial effects against oxidative/nitrosative stress status, including that involving mitochondrial dysfunction. This review summarizes the data and mechanisms of action of melatonin in relation to mitochondrial pathologies. ",Review,Mitochondrial Health,Spain

However, clinical trials with such antioxidants as ascorbic acid and vitamin E, failed to produce the expected beneficial results. On the other hand, important biomolecules can be modified by the introduction of oxygen atoms by means of non-oxidative hydroxyl radicals. In addition, hydroxyl radicals can reduce disulfide bonds in proteins, specifically fibrinogen, resulting in their unfolding and scrambled refolding into abnormal spatial configurations. Consequences of this reaction are observed in many diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer and neurological disorders, and can be prevented by the action of non-reducing substances. Moreover, many therapeutic substances, traditionally classified as antioxidants, accept electrons and thus are effective oxidants. It is described in this paper that hydroxyl radicals can be generated by ferric ions without any oxidizing agent. In view of the well-known damaging effect of poorly chelated iron in the human body, numerous natural products containing iron binding agents can be essential in the maintenance of human health. However, beneficial effects of the great number of phytochemicals that are endowed with hydroxyl radical scavenging and/or iron chelating activities should not be considered as a proof for oxidative stress.

There are several methods to ingest or consume H(2), including inhaling hydrogen gas, drinking H(2)-dissolved water (hydrogen water), taking a hydrogen bath, injecting H(2)- dissolved saline (hydrogen saline), dropping hydrogen saline onto the eye, and increasing the production of intestinal H(2) by bacteria.

Contrary to this awareness, detailed mechanisms whereby gases exert their actions, in particular in vivo, have been unclear because of several reasons. Gaseous signaling involves diverse reactions with metal centers of metalloproteins and thiol modification of cysteine residues of proteins. Both the multiplicity of gas targets and the technical limitations in accessing local gas concentrations make dissection of exact actions of any gas mediator a challenge. However, a series of advanced technologies now offer ways to explore gas-responsive regulatory processes in vivo. Imaging mass spectrometry combined with quantitative metabolomics by capillary-electrophoresis/mass spectrometry reveals spatio-temporal profiles of many metabolites. Comparing the metabolic footprinting of murine samples with a targeted deletion of a specific gas-producing enzyme makes it possible to determine sites of actions of the gas.

Acute oxidative stress causes serious damage to tissues, and persistent oxidative stress is one of the causes of many common diseases, cancer and the aging process; however, there has been little success in developing an effective antioxidant with no side effect. We have reported that molecular hydrogen has potential as an effective antioxidant for medical applications [Ohsawa et al., Nat. Med. 13 (2007) 688-694]. Scope of review: We review the recent progress toward therapeutic and preventive applications of hydrogen. Since we published the first paper in Nature Medicine, effects of hydrogen have been reported in more than 38 diseases, physiological states and clinical tests in leading biological/medical journals. Based on this cumulative knowledge, the beneficial biological effects of hydrogen have been confirmed. There are several ways to intake or consume hydrogen, including inhaling hydrogen gas, drinking hydrogen-dissolved water, taking a hydrogen bath, injecting hydrogen-dissolved saline, dropping hydrogen-dissolved saline into the eyes, and increasing the production of intestinal hydrogen by bacteria. Hydrogen has many advantages for therapeutic and preventive applications, and shows not only anti-oxidative stress effects, but also has various anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects. Preliminary clinical trials show that drinking hydrogen-dissolved water seems to improve the pathology of mitochondrial disorders. Major conclusions: Hydrogen has biological benefits toward preventive and therapeutic applications; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the marked effects of small amounts of hydrogen remain elusive. General significance: Hydrogen is a novel antioxidant with great potential for actual medical applications. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Biochemistry of Mitochondria.

Furthermore, concepts for protective shielding also pose a technically challenging issue due to the nature of cosmic radiation and current mass and power constraints with modern exploration technology. The concern regarding exposure to cosmic radiation is biological damage that is associated with increased oxidative stress. It is therefore important and would be enabling to mitigate and/or prevent oxidative stress prior to the development of clinical symptoms and disease. This paper hypothesizes a 'systems biology' approach in which a combination of chemical and biological mitigation techniques are used conjunctively. It proposes using new, therapeutic, medical gases as chemical radioprotectors for radical scavenging and as biological signaling molecules for management of the body's response to exposure. From reviewing radiochemistry of water, biological effects of CO, H2, NO, and H2S gas, and mechanisms of radiation biology, it can be concluded that this approach may have therapeutic potential for radiation exposure. Furthermore, it also appears to have similar potential for curtailing the pathogenesis of other diseases in which oxidative stress has been implicated including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic inflammatory disease, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, cataracts, and aging.

Acarbose has gained importance as a drug used widely to treat Diabetes Mellitus Type 2,as it acts on the small intestine by competitively inhibiting enzymes that delay the release of glucose from complex carbohydrates, thereby specifically reducing postprandial glucose excursion. The main side-effect of treatment with Acarbose, flatulence, occurs when undigested carbohydrates are fermented by colonic bacteria, resulting in considerable amounts of hydrogen. We found that the enteric benefits of Acarbose are partly due to be their ability to neutralise oxidative stress via increased production of H₂ in the gastrointestinal tract.

It is also associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, which can result in cardiovascular disease and mortality. The therapeutic goal is to control the systemic inflammation to obtain not only the remission of symptoms, but also improve general state of health. Although recent biologic immunosuppressive therapies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines have spawned a paradigm shift regarding the prognosis of RA, these therapies possess inherent side effects. Also, early diagnosis of the disease remains confounded by uncertainty. While the mechanisms responsible for the onset of RA remain unclear, reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a significant role in the pathogenesis of RA. ROS play a central role both upstream and downstream of NF-κB and TNFα pathways, which are located at the center of the inflammatory response. Among the ROS, the hydroxyl radical is the most harmful, and molecular hydrogen (H2) is a selective scavenger for this species. Recently, it has been shown that H2 is useful when administered along with the conventional therapy in RA as it acts to reduce oxidative stress in the patients. Especially in the early stage, H2 showed significant therapeutic potential, which also seemed to assist diagnosis and treatment decisions of RA. The possible expectations regarding the potential benefits of H2 by reducing the oxidative stress, resulting from inflammatory factors, are raised and discussed here.

Although several clinical trials have shown that anti-oxidative therapy can effectively control hepatitis activities in the short term, the long-term effect remains obscure. Several trials of long-term anti-oxidant protocols aimed at treating cerebrovascular diseases or cancer development have failed to produce a benefit. This might be explained by the non-selective anti-oxidative properties of these drugs. Molecular hydrogen is an effective antioxidant that reduces only cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several diseases associated with oxidative stress are sensitive to hydrogen. The progress of NASH to hepatocellular carcinoma can be controlled using hydrogen-rich water. Thus, targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress might be a good candidate for NASH treatment.

H2 has a number of advantages exhibiting extensive effects: H2 rapidly diffuses into tissues and cells, and it is mild enough neither to disturb metabolic redox reactions nor to affect signaling reactive oxygen species; therefore, there should be no or little adverse effects of H2. There are several methods to ingest or consume H2; inhaling H2 gas, drinking H2-dissolved water (H2-water), injecting H2-dissolved saline (H2-saline), taking an H2 bath, or dropping H2-saline into the eyes. The numerous publications on its biological and medical benefits revealed that H2 reduces oxidative stress not only by direct reactions with strong oxidants, but also indirectly by regulating various gene expressions. Moreover, by regulating the gene expressions, H2 functions as an anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic, and stimulates energy metabolism. In addition to growing evidence obtained by model animal experiments, extensive clinical examinations were performed or are under investigation.

Recently, a number of studies have explored the utility of inhaled hydrogen gas, or of hydrogen-saturated water, administered parenterally or orally, in rodent models of pathology and in clinical trials, oftentimes with very positive outcomes. The efficacy of orally ingested hydrogen-rich water (HW) has been particularly surprising, given that only transient and rather small increments in plasma hydrogen can be achieved by this method. A recent study in mice has discovered that orally administered HW provokes increased gastric production of the orexic hormone ghrelin, and that this ghrelin mediates the favorable impact of HW on a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. The possibility that most of the benefits observed with HW in experimental studies are mediated by ghrelin merits consideration. Ghrelin is well known to function as an appetite stimulant and secretagogue for growth hormone, but it influences physiological function throughout the body via interaction with the widely express GHS-R1a receptor. Rodent and, to a more limited extent, clinical studies establish that ghrelin has versatile neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing activity, favorably impacts vascular health, exerts anti-inflammatory activity useful in autoimmune disorders, and is markedly hepatoprotective. The stimulatory impact of ghrelin on GH-IGF-I activity, while potentially beneficial in sarcopenia or cachectic disorders, does raise concerns regarding the long-term impact of ghrelin up-regulation on cancer risk.

Increasing evidence indicates that oxidative stress is an important risk factor contributing to the development of cataract. Moreover, the enhancement of the antioxidant defense system may be beneficial to prevent or delay the cataractogenesis. The term oxidative stress has been defined as a disturbance in the equilibrium status of oxidant/antioxidant systems with progressive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in intact cells. Superfluous ROS can damage proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids within ocular tissues that are closely correlated with cataract formation. Therefore, prevention of oxidative stress damage by antioxidants might be considered as a viable means of medically offsetting the progression of this vision-impairing disease. Molecular hydrogen has recently been verified to have protective and therapeutic value as an antioxidant through its ability to selectively reduce cytotoxic ROS such as hydroxyl radical (OH). Hitherto, hydrogen has been used as a therapeutic element against multiple pathologies in both animal models and human patients. Unlike most well-known antioxidants, which are unable to successfully target organelles, hydrogen has advantageous distribution characteristics enabling it to penetrate biomembranes and diffuse into the cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus. Consequently, we speculate that hydrogen might be an effective antioxidant to protect against lens damage, and it is important to further explore the biological mechanism underlying its potential therapeutic effects.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been recognized as critical initiators of the photoreceptor apoptosis in RP. Photoreceptor survival in RP mutants will not only require the inhibition of effectors of apoptotic machinery, but also the elimination of the initiating upstream signals, such as ROS. These cytotoxic ROS should be neutralized by the antioxidant defense system, otherwise they would interact with the macromolecules essential for photoreceptor survival. Hydrogen is a promising gaseous agent that has come to the forefront of therapeutic research over the last few years. It has been verified that hydrogen is capable of neutralizing the cytotoxic ROS selectively, rectifying abnormities in the apoptotic cascades, and attenuating the related inflammatory response. Hydrogen is so mild that it does not disturb the metabolic oxidation-reduction reactions or disrupt the physiologic ROS involved in cell signaling. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that hydrogen might be an effective therapeutic agent to slow or prevent photoreceptor degeneration in RP retinas.

However, the enzymatic basis for these processes is incompletely understood and the hydrogenases responsible have not been investigated. In this work, we surveyed the genomic and metagenomics of hydrogenases in the human colon to infer dominant mechanisms of H2 cycling. The data demonstrate that 70% of gastrointestinal microbial species listed in the Human Microbiome Project encode the genetic capacity to metabolise H2. A wide variety of anaerobically-adapted hydrogenases were present, with [FeFe]-hydrogenases predominant. We subsequently analysed the hydrogenase gene content of stools from 20 healthy human subjects. The hydrogenase gene content of all samples was overwhelmingly dominated by fermentative and electron-bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenases emerging from the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. This study supports that H2 metabolism in the human gut is driven by fermentative H2 production and interspecies H2 transfer. However, it suggests that electron-bifurcation rather than respiration is the dominant mechanism of H2 reoxidation in the human colon, generating reduced ferredoxin to sustain carbon-fixation (e.g. acetogenesis) and respiration (via the Rnf complex).

Moreover, H2 can regulate the intracellular signal as a signal modulator. However, it is still unclear in cell signaling involved in testosterone hormone production. Male fertility depends on the intra-testicular testosterone concentration, which is produced by the Leydig cell in the seminiferous tubules in testes. Although moderate amounts of ROS are needed for normal sperm function, the higher amounts might decrease testosterone production. High ROS decreases testosterone hormone production by dysregulation of hormonal signal from the hypothalamus to the Leydig cell as a result of redox imbalance. Lower level of testosterone fails to support the Leydig cell for the progression of spermatogenesis. Superoxide anion (O2-), hydroxyl radical (OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) could also attack the DNA, lipid and protein, disrupting sperm structure and function and aggravating the milieu of male fertility and spermatogenesis. H2 regulates intracellular MAPK downstream cAMP signal and Ca2+ signal as a signal modulator to antagonize ROS signaling. Thus H2 can play a role in modulating signals involved in testosterone hormone production to improve male fertility caused by redox imbalance. We therefore hypothesize that molecular hydrogen may enhance testosterone production via cellular redox balance. By this hypothesis, we anticipate that molecular hydrogen may be an effective remedy in male infertility. ",Hypothesis,Reproductive Health,South Korea

It suggests indirect signaling of H2 and gastrointestinal tract is involved. Indirect effects of H2 could be tested by giving H2 water only before nerve injury, as preconditioning. For example, preconditioning of H2 for certain a period (∼7 days) in Parkinson's disease model mice shows significant neuroprotection. As the mechanism of indirect effect, H2 in drinking water induces ghrelin production and release from the stomach via β1-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Released ghrelin circulates in the body, being transported across the blood-brain barrier, activates its receptor, growth-hormone secretagogue receptor.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive, but are likely related to the signaling pathways involved. This review focuses on the research progress and potential mechanisms of molecular hydrogen against sepsis to provide a theoretical basis for clinical treatment. ",Review,Sepsis,China

Hydrogen agronomy focuses mainly on the mechanism of hydrogen gas (H2) biology effects in agriculture, and provides a theoretical foundation for the practice of hydrogen agriculture, a component of the new agriculture. Previous research on the biological effects of H2 focused chiefly on medicine. The mechanism of selective antioxidant is the main theoretical basis of hydrogen medicine. Subsequent experiments have demonstrated that H2 can regulate the growth and development of plant crops, edible fungus, and livestock, and enhance the tolerance of these agriculturally important organisms against abiotic and biotic stresses. Even more importantly, H2 can regulate the growth and development of crops by changing the soil microbial community composition and structure. Use of H2 can also improve the nutritional value and postharvest quality of agricultural products.

Hydrogen gas, a promising neuroprotective agent, has been a focus of study due to its potent antioxidative properties. In translational research into adult diseases, hydrogen has been shown to be neuroprotective in disorders such as cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury, and in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Animal and human studies have verified the safety and feasibility of molecular hydrogen. However, despite extensive research on its efficacy in adults, only a few studies have investigated its application in pediatric and neonatal medicine. Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is characterized by damage to neurons and other cells of the nervous system.

However, therapeutic/therapy-assisted gases (NO, CO, H2S, H2, O2, SO2 and CO2) and most of their prodrugs lack the abilities of active intratumoral accumulation and controlled gas release, resulting in limited cancer therapy efficacy and potential side effects. Therefore, development of nanomedicines to realize tumor-targeted and controlled release of therapeutic/therapy-assisted gases is greatly desired, and also the combination of other therapeutic modes with gas therapy by multifunctional nanocarrier platforms can augment cancer therapy efficacy and also reduce their side effects.

Recent studies have found that H2 is also useful in the treatment of pancreatitis, which may be related to the mechanism of antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, regulation of immunity and regulation of molecular pathways. This review focuses on the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and the research progress and potential mechanisms of H2 against pancreatitis to provide theoretical bases for future research and clinical application of H2 therapy for pancreatitis.

Although H2 has been thought to be an inert gas in living bodies for many years, an animal study reported that inhalation of H2 gas decreased oxidative stress and suppressed brain injury caused by ischemia and reperfusion injury due to its antioxidant action. Since then, the antioxidant action of H2 has attracted considerable attention and many studies have reported on its benefits. Most studies have reported the effects of H2 on diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cerebral infarction, and Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known regarding its effects on healthy subjects and exercise. Thus far, including our study, only 6 studies have explored the effect of H2 on exercise. H2 is the smallest molecule and therefore can easily penetrate the cellular membrane and rapidly diffuse into organelles. H2 is thought to be able to selectively reduce hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite and does not affect physiologically reactive species. H2 can be supplied to the body through multiple routes of administration, such as oral intake of H2 water and H2 bathing. Therefore, H2 may be a potential alternative strategy for conventional exogenous antioxidant interventions in sports science. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence regarding the effects of H2 intake on changes in physiological and biochemical parameters, centering on exercise-induced oxidative stress, for each intake method.

Over the years, this simple molecule appears to drive more and more scientific attention perhaps due to a dualism of H2 affirmative features demonstrated in numerous in vitro, animal and human studies on one side, and stillpuzzling mechanism(s) of its biological activity on the other. Up to this point, H2 was scrutinized for more than 170 different disease models and pathologies, and many research groups across the world have lately started to dynamically investigate its conceivable performance-enhancing potential. Methods: We outlined here the studies indexed in leading research databases (PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, JSTORE) that explored the effects of hydrogen on exercise performance, and also addressed important restraints, open questions, and windows of opportunities for forthcoming research and possible H2 enactment in exercise physiology. About two dozen trials have been identified in this domain, with most published during the past 5 years, while drinking hydrogen-rich water recognized as the most convenient method to deliver H2 in both animal and human studies. Results: Either administered as an inhalational gas, enteral hydrogen-rich water, or intravenous hydrogen-rich saline, H2 seems to favorably affect various exercise performance outcomes and biomarkers of exercise-associated fatigue, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Not all studies have shown corroborative effects, and it appears that the gold-standard protocol for applying H2 in the field of exercise science does not exist at the moment, with studies markedly differ in the dose of H2 administered, the duration of a treatment, and the source of hydrogen. Conclusion: H2 is a newfangled and rather effective performance-enhancing agent yet its promising ergogenic potency has to be further validated and characterized in more well-controlled, appropriately sampled and long-term mechanistic trials. Also, appropriate regulation of hydrogen utilization in sport as an exotic medical gas may require distinctive legislative actions of relevant regulatory agencies in the future.

H2 treatment of corneal damage caused by alkali or UVB suppressed scar formation. The most unique application of H2 in the ophthalmological field appears to be its use in phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Ultrasound oscillation produces ·OH through the cavitation phenomenon in the anterior chamber of the eye, which induces oxidative insults in the corneal endothelium. Phacoemulsification using H2 dissolved in the irrigation solution significantly suppressed the corneal endothelial damage.

Although antioxidant substances have long been recognized as a measure of alleviating oxidative stress and restoring redox balance, the arsenal of effective means of preventing the development of various disorders is still limited. There is an emerging field that utilizes molecular hydrogen (H2 ) as a scavenger of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Among the remarkable characteristics of H2 is its ability to counteract harmful effects of hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite without affecting activity of functionally important ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide. The beneficial effects of H2 have been documented in numerous clinical studies and studies on animal models and cell cultures. However, the established scavenging activity of H2 can only partially explain its beneficial effects, because the effects are achieved at very low concentrations of H2 . Given the rate of H2 diffusion, such low concentrations may not be sufficient to scavenge continuously generated ROS. H2 can also act as a signaling molecule and induce defense responses. However, the exact targets and mechanism(s) by which H2 exerts these effects are unknown.

Some researchers have proposed that H2 acts as a hormetic stress. This hypothesis does not reconcile H2 being non-toxic in nature, even at high doses. Hormetic stressors have contributed to evolutionary adaptations, with the absence of these stressors causing cellular dysfunction. H2 has played an intimate role in the evolution of our planetâ€™s atmosphere, the evolution of mitochondria and of life on the planet.

However, we showed previously that inhalation of H2 markedly suppresses brain injury induced by focal ischemia-reperfusion by buffering oxidative stress. Although the reaction constant of H2 with hydroxyl radical in aqueous solution is two to three orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional antioxidants, we showed that hydroxyl radical generated by the Fenton reaction reacts with H2 at room temperature without a catalyst. Suppression of hydroxyl radical by H2 has been applied in ophthalmic surgery. However, many of the anti-inflammatory and other therapeutic effects of H2 cannot be completely explained by its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species. H2 administration is protective in several disease models, and preculture in the presence of H2 suppresses oxidative stress-induced cell death. Specifically, H2 administration induces mitochondrial oxidative stress and activates Nrf2; this phenomenon, in which mild mitochondrial stress leaves the cell less susceptible to subsequent perturbations, is called mitohormesis. Based on these findings, we conclude that crosstalk between antioxidative stress pathways and the anti-inflammatory response is the most important molecular mechanism involved in the protective function of H2 , and that regulation of the immune system underlies H2 efficacy.

We overturned the concept by demonstrating that H2 exhibits antioxidant effects and protects cells against oxidative stress. Subsequently, it has been revealed that H2 has multiple functions in addition to antioxidant effects, including ant-inflammatory, anti-allergic functions, and as a cell death and autophagy regulation. Additionally, H2 stimulates energy metabolism. Because H2 does not readily react with most biomolecules without a catalyst, it is essential to identify the primary targets with which H2 reacts or interacts directly. As a first event, H2 may react directly with strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in vivo. This review addresses the key issues related to this in vivo reaction. •OH may have a physiological role because it triggers a free radical chain reaction and may be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ - or mitochondrial ATP-dependent K+ - channeling. In the subsequent pathway, H2 suppressed a free radical chain reaction, leading to decreases in lipid peroxide and its end products. Derived from the peroxides, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal functions as a mediator that up-regulates multiple functional PGC-1α. As the other direct target in vitro and in vivo, H2 intervenes in the free radical chain reaction to modify oxidized phospholipids, which may act as an antagonist of Ca2+ -channels. The resulting suppression of Ca2+ - signaling inactivates multiple functional NFAT and CREB transcription factors, which may explain H2 multifunctionality. This review also addresses the involvement of NFAT in the beneficial role of H2 in COVID-19, Alzheimer's disease and advanced cancer. We discuss some unsolved issues of H2 action on lipopolysaccharide signaling, MAPK and NF-κB pathways and the Nrf2 paradox.

ROS can cause direct deleterious effects by damaging proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids as well as exert detrimental effects on several cell signaling pathways. However, ROS are important in many cellular functions. The injurious effect of excessive ROS can hypothetically be mitigated by exogenous antioxidants, but clinically this intervention is often not favorable. In contrast, molecular hydrogen provides a variety of advantages for mitigating oxidative stress due to its unique physical and chemical properties. H2 may be superior to conventional antioxidants, since it can selectively reduce ●OH radicals while preserving important ROS that are otherwise used for normal cellular signaling.

Studies on the mitigation of side effects following exposure to accidental radiation events are ongoing. Recent studies have shown that radiation can activate several signaling pathways, leading to changes in the metabolism of free radicals including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). Cellular and molecular mechanisms show that radiation can cause disruption of normal reduction/oxidation (redox) system. Mitochondria malfunction following exposure to radiation and mutations in mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) have a key role in chronic oxidative stress. Furthermore, exposure to radiation leads to infiltration of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells, which are important sources of ROS and NO. These cells generate free radicals via upregulation of some pro-oxidant enzymes such as NADPH oxidases, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Epigenetic changes also have a key role in a similar way. Other mediators such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which are involved in the normal metabolism of cells have also been shown to regulate cell death following exposure to radiation. These mechanisms are tissue specific. Inhibition or activation of each of these targets can be suggested for mitigation of radiation injury in a specific tissue. In the current paper, we review the cellular and molecular changes in the metabolism of cells and ROS/NO following exposure to radiation. Furthermore, the possible strategies for mitigation of radiation injury through modulation of cellular metabolism in irradiated organs will be discussed. ",Review,Radioprotection,Iran

It has been suggested that the presence of H2 may act as an antioxidant or on the antioxidant capacity of cells, perhaps through the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals. H2 may act through influencing heme oxygenase activity or through the interaction with reactive nitrogen species. However, controversy exists around all the mechanisms suggested. Here, the downstream mechanisms in which H2 may be involved are critically reviewed, with a particular emphasis on the H2 mitigation of stress responses. Hopefully, this review will provide insight that may inform future research in this area. ",Review,Hydrogen Biology,United Kingdom

The antioxidant effects of H2 are also often mediated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), although the exact mechanism remains elusive. Alternatively, it has been proposed that H2 can propagate its effects through the reduction of Fe3+ in various redox-active proteins, which is the focus of this review.

On the time scale that protein production is negligible, water flow in and out of the cell determines the cell volume variation. Water flux follows hydraulic and osmotic gradients; the latter is generated by various ion channels, transporters, and pumps in the cell membrane. Compared to the widely studied roles of sodium, potassium, and chloride in cell volume regulation, the effects of proton and bicarbonate are less understood. In this work, we use mathematical models to analyze how proton and bicarbonate, combined with sodium, potassium, chloride, and buffer species, regulate cell volume upon inhibition of ion channels, transporters, and pumps. The model includes several common, widely expressed ion transporters and focuses on obtaining generic outcomes. Results show that the intracellular osmolarity remains almost constant before and after cell volume change. The steady-state cell volume does not depend on water permeability. In addition, to ensure the stability of cell volume and ion concentrations, cells need to develop redundant mechanisms to maintain homeostasis, i.e., multiple ion channels or transporters are involved in the flux of the same ion species. These results provide insights for molecular mechanisms of cell volume regulation with additional implications for water-driven cell migration. ",Review,Hydrogen Biology,United States

This meta-analysis aimed to define the composition of human intestinal gases and changes associated with diet. Methods: Studies were identified by systematic research of the MEDLINE(Ovid), Scopus, and Cochrane databases. Studies that measured the concentration of intestinal gases in healthy adult humans were retrieved. The JBI critical appraisal tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias. The primary outcomes analysed were the concentration of the most prevalent colonic gases. Participants were divided into groups according to dietary fibre content. Results: Eleven studies were included. The following gases were identified in similar concentrations across all studies (mean ± standard deviation): nitrogen (65.1 ± 20.89%), oxygen (2.3 ± 0.98%), carbon dioxide (9.9 ± 1.6%), hydrogen (2.9 ± 0.7%), and methane (14.4 ± 3.7%). Differences according to the dietary fibre were observed, with a positive correlation between fibre and volume of gas produced, particularly in fermented gases (carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane). Discussion: The meta-analysis has found defined concentrations of the five most common gases present in human colonic gas. Limitations included heterogenic methodologies, a low number of participants, and few recent studies.

Upon analysis of published and proprietary data, we concluded that these three medical gases can manipulate the neuroendocrine system, by modulating the production or release of hormones via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid, hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes, or the gastrointestinal pathway. With repeated administration of the gases over time, these modulations become a predictable consequence of conditioned homeostatic reflexes, resulting in regulation of physiological activity. For example, the regular activation of the unconditioned defense reflex in response to repeated intoxication by ozone leads to the formation of an anticipatory stable conditioned response, which counteracts the toxic action of O3.

Therefore, we conducted a literature review on the mechanism by which H2 improves acute and chronic fatigue in animals and healthy people and showed that the attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction by H2 may be involved in the ameliorative effects. Although further clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy and mechanism of H2 gas in ME/CFS, our literature review suggested that H2 gas may be an effective medical gas for the treatment of ME/CFS.

Over the past decade, molecular hydrogen has gained the attention of both preclinical and clinical researchers. The death of pyramidal neurons in especially the CA1 area of the hippocampus, increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, neuroinflammation, amyloid accumulation, tau protein dysfunction, brain atrophy, cognitive deficits and dementia are considered an integral part of the phenomena occurring during brain neurodegeneration after ischemia. This review focuses on assessing the current state of knowledge about the neuroprotective effects of molecular hydrogen following ischemic brain injury. Recent studies in animal models of focal or global cerebral ischemia and cerebral ischemia in humans suggest that hydrogen has pleiotropic neuroprotective properties. One potential mechanism explaining some of the general health benefits of using hydrogen is that it may prevent aging-related changes in cellular proteins such as amyloid and tau protein. We also present evidence that, following ischemia, hydrogen improves cognitive and neurological deficits and prevents or delays the onset of neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The available evidence suggests that molecular hydrogen has neuroprotective properties and may be a new therapeutic agent in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as neurodegeneration following cerebral ischemia with progressive dementia. We also present the experimental and clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of hydrogen use after cerebral ischemia. The therapeutic benefits of gas therapy open up new promising directions in breaking the translational barrier in the treatment of ischemic stroke. ",Review,Brain Health,Poland

Many studies have shown various alterations of the gut microbiota in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, including the lower abundance of hydrogen-producing bacteria that could instigate the shortage of hydrogen output. Since dihydrogen has many important bioactivities, including cytoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic, its malproduction in COVID-19 might contribute to the disease progression and severity. On the other hand, replenishing dihydrogen by exogenous administration could be beneficial in COVID-19 for both patient- and clinical-reported outcomes.

However, recent evidence indicates that hydrogen has multi-faceted pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. An increased number of studies are being conducted on the application of hydrogen in various diseases, especially those affecting the renal system. Summary: Hydrogen can be inhaled, as a gas or liquid, and can be administered orally, intravenously, or locally. Hydrogen can rapidly enter suborganelles such as mitochondria and nucleus by simple diffusion, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggering DNA damage. Hydrogen can selectively scavenge hydroxyl radical (•OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-), but not other reactive oxygen radicals with physiological functions, such as peroxyanion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Although the regulatory effect of hydrogen on the signal transduction pathway has been confirmed, the specific mechanism of its influence on signal molecules remains unknown. Although many studies have investigated the therapeutic and preventive effects of H2 in cellular and animal experiments, clinical trials are few and still far behind. As a result, more clinical trials are required to investigate the role of hydrogen in kidney disease, as well as the effect of its dose, timing, and form on the overall efficacy. Large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials will be required before hydrogen can be used to treat renal illnesses.

In this review, we focus on the role of H2 in plant responses to abiotic stresses, such as temperature, osmotic stress, light, paraquat (PQ)-induced oxidative stresses, and metal stresses. In general, H2 can alleviate environmental stresses by improving the antioxidant defense system, photosynthetic capacity, re-establishing ion homeostasis and glutathione homeostasis, maintaining nutrient element homeostasis, mediating glucose metabolism and flavonoid pathways, regulating heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling, and interaction between H2 and nitric oxide (NO), carbonic oxide (CO), or plant hormones.

The mechanism responsible for these results remains unknown but may be due to electrode degradation associated with the production of higher pH, in which platinum nanoparticles and other metals that have harmful effects may leach into the water. Clinical studies have reported that, when ERW exceeds pH 9.8, some people develop dangerous hyperkalemia. Accordingly, regulations on ERW mandate that the pH of ERW should not exceed 9.8. It is recommended that those with impaired kidney function refrain from using ERW without medical supervision. Other potential safety concerns include impaired growth, reduced mineral, vitamin, and nutrient absorption, harmful bacterial overgrowth, and damage to the mucosal lining causing excessive thirst. Since the concentration of H2 in ERW may be well below therapeutic levels, users are encouraged to frequently measure the H2 concentration with accurate methods, avoiding ORP or ORP-based H2 meters.

Molecular Hydrogen Is the Exclusive Agent Responsible for the Therapeutic Effects ,2022,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,10.3390/ijms232314750 ,"Numerous benefits have been attributed to alkaline-electrolyzed-reduced water (ERW). Sometimes these claims are associated with easily debunked concepts. The observed benefits have been conjectured to be due to the intrinsic properties of ERW (e.g., negative oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), alkaline pH, H2 gas), as well enigmatic characteristics (e.g., altered water structure, microclusters, free electrons, active hydrogen, mineral hydrides). The associated pseudoscientific marketing has contributed to the reluctance of mainstream science to accept ERW as having biological effects. Finally, through many in vitro and in vivo studies, each one of these propositions was examined and refuted one-by-one until it was conclusively demonstrated that H2 was the exclusive agent responsible for both the negative ORP and the observed therapeutic effects of ERW. This article briefly apprised the history of ERW and comprehensively reviewed the sequential research demonstrating the importance of H2. We illustrated that the effects of ERW could be readily explained by the known biological effects of H2 and by utilizing conventional chemistry without requiring any metaphysical conjecture (e.g., microclustering, free electrons, etc.) or reliance on implausible notions (e.g., alkaline water neutralizes acidic waste).

Numerous health benefits including antioxidant effects have been attributed to a negative ORP value. A greater negative ORP value is often incorrectly interpreted to mean a greater degree of health benefits and/or a high concentration of H2. Some hydrogen meters use the Nernst equation to calculate the concentration of H2 based on the measured ORP value. Unfortunately, due to the fundamental issues with the ORP meter, the calculated H2 value may be very inaccurate. Using the Nernst equation, we performed an in silico analysis of the ORP as a function of pH, temperature, and H2 concentration. Our analysis shows that a one unit increase in pH (e.g., 7–8) influences the ORP by as much as increasing the H2 concentration by 100 times (e.g., 1–100 mg/L). Similarly, at a saturated H2 concentration (1.57 mg/L) and pH 7, every ∆T of 20 °C changes the ORP by ≈ 30 mV. This is comparable to changing the H2 concentration by a factor of 10 (0.1 mg/L to 1 mg/L). Finally, to measure H2 within 0.1 mg/L, ORP meters need to have an accuracy of about 0.8 mV. However, ORP meters have an error range of at least ±10 mV, which corresponds to a potential error in measured H2 concentration of nearly 2 mg/L (≈125% error). This analysis shows that pH, temperature, and the intrinsic ORP errors can individually influence the ORP greater than the entire contribution of dissolved H2 within normally used ranges. In fact, this can easily result in a water sample with a greater negative ORP than another despite having significantly less H2. This makes it impossible to consistently determine if one water sample has more H2 than another water sample. Therefore, we can only conclude, based on a negative ORP reading, that, excluding the possibility of other reductive redox couples, some level of dissolved H2 is present in the water. Accordingly, ORP and ORP-based H2 meters are not recommended for testing or comparing the concentration of H2 in water. Experimental studies are warranted to determine if the ORP error is as great as or greater than what is predicted via this in silico analysis.",Editorial,Hydrogen Biology,United States

Since the landmark finding reported in 2007 found that hydrogen reduced the levels of peroxynitrite anions and hydroxyl free radicals in ischemic stroke, molecular hydrogen's antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects have aroused widespread interest. Due to its excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, hydrogen therapy via different routes of administration exhibits great therapeutic potential for a wide range of brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, depression, anxiety, traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. This paper reviews the routes for hydrogen administration, the effects of hydrogen on the previously mentioned brain disorders, and the primary mechanism underlying hydrogen's neuroprotection. Finally, we discuss hydrogen therapy's remaining issues and challenges in brain disorders. We conclude that understanding the exact molecular target, finding novel routes, and determining the optimal dosage for hydrogen administration is critical for future studies and applications.

However, such effects have not been comprehensively characterized. Objective: To systematically assess the effects of in taking H2 on fatigue and aerobic capacity in healthy adults. Methods: The search was conducted in August 2022 in five databases. Studies with randomized controlled or crossover designs that investigated the rating of perceived exertion (RPE), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), and endurance performance were selected. The data (mean ± standard deviation and sample size) were extracted from the included studies and were converted into the standardized mean difference (SMD). Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Subgroup analysis was used to analyze potential sources of heterogeneity due to intervention period, training status, and type of exercise.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of publications across five databases. The following keywords were used for search strategy: [""hydrogen""[Mesh] or ""molecular hydrogen"" or ""hydrogen rich water"" or ""hydrogen-rich water"" or ""hydrogen rich saline""] and [""Oxidative Stress""[Mesh] or ""Antioxidative Stress"" or ""Oxidative Damage"" or ""Oxidative Injury"" or ""Oxidative Cleavage""] and [""randomized controlled trial""[Mesh] or ""randomized"" or ""RCT""].

Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively characterize the effects of H₂ supplementation on physical performance (i.e., endurance, muscular strength, and explosive power), providing knowledge that can inform strategies using H2 for enhancing physical performance. Methods: We conducted a literature search of six databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Sport-Discus, Embase, and PsycINFO) according to the PRISMA guidelines. The data were extracted from the included studies and converted into the standardized mean difference (SMD). After that, we performed random-effects meta-analyses and used the I 2 statistic to evaluate heterogeneity. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the quality of the evidence obtained from this meta-analysis. Results: In total, 27 publications consisting of 597 participants were included. The search finally included aerobic endurance, anaerobic endurance, muscular strength, lower limb explosive power, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), blood lactate (BLA), and average heart rate (HRavg) in the effect size (ES) synthesis. The ES of H2 on aerobic endurance, including V̇O2max (SMD = 0.09, p = 0.394; I 2 = 0%) and aerobic endurance exercise (SMD = 0.04, p = 0.687; I 2 = 0%), were not significant and trivial; the ES of H2 on 30 s maximal anaerobic endurance (SMD = 0.19, p = 0.239; I 2 = 0%) was not significant and trivial; the ES of H2 on muscular strength (SMD = 0.19, p = 0.265; I 2 = 0%) was not significant and trivial; but the ES of H2 on lower limb explosive power (SMD = 0.30, p = 0.018; I 2 = 0%) was significant and small. In addition, H2 reduces RPE (SMD = -0.37, p = 0.009; I 2 = 58.0%) and BLA (SMD = -0.37, p = 0.001; I 2 = 22.0%) during exercise, but not HRavg (SMD = -0.27, p = 0.094; I 2 = 0%). Conclusion: These findings suggest that H2 supplementation is favorable in healthy adults to improve lower limb explosive power, alleviate fatigue, and boost BLA clearance, but may not be effectively improving aerobic and anaerobic endurance and muscular strength. Future studies with more rigorous designs are thus needed to examine and confirm the effects of H2 on these important functionalities in humans.

"Tzuzuki, Nobuyoshi",,"Wasano, Koichiro",Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss: A review focused on the contribution of vascular pathologies ,2024,"Auris, Nasus, Larynx",10.1016/j.anl.2024.05.009 ,"Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is characterized by abruptly appearing hearing loss, sometimes accompanied by vertigo. Vascular pathologies (e.g., cochlear ischemia, or cochlear infarction) are one of the most likely causes of ISSNHL. This review aims to present current understanding of inner ear anatomy, clinical features of ISSNHL, and its treatment strategies. The labyrinthine artery is the only end artery supplying blood to the inner ear, and it has three branches: the anterior vestibular artery, the main cochlear artery, and the vestibulo-cochlear artery (VCA). Occlusion of the VCA can be caused by a variety of factors. The VCA courses through a narrow bone canal. ISSNHL is usually diagnosed after excluding retrocochlear pathologies of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), such as vestibular schwannoma. Therefore, a head MRI or assessing auditory brainstem responses are recommended for patients with SSNHL. Severe SSNHL patients with high CHADS2 scores, an index of stroke risk, have a significantly lower rate of vestibular schwannoma than severe SSNHL patients with low CHADS2 scores, suggesting that severe ISSNHL in individuals at high risk of stroke is caused by vascular impairments. Intralabyrinthine hemorrhage causes SSNHL or vertigo, as in ISSNHL. The diagnosis of intralabyrinthine hemorrhage requires careful interpretation of MRI, and a small percentage of patients diagnosed with ISSNHL may in fact have intralabyrinthine hemorrhage. Many studies have reported an association between ISSNHL and atherosclerosis or cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease), and subsequent risk of stroke in patients with ISSNHL may be elevated compared to controls. Increased hearing level on the healthy ear side, high Framingham risk score, high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, high platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and severe white matter lesions may be poor prognostic factors for patients with ISSNHL. The association between thrombosis-related genes and susceptibility to ISSNHL has been reported in many studies (e.g., coagulation factor 2, coagulation factor 5, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, platelet-associated genes, a homocysteine metabolism-related enzyme gene, endothelin-1, nitric oxide 3, phosphodiesterase 4D, complement factor H, and protein kinase C-eta). Treatment of ISSNHL with the aim of mitigating the vascular impairment in the inner ear includes systemically administered steroids, intratympanic steroid injections, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, prostaglandin E1, defibrinogenation therapy, and hydrogen inhalation therapy, but there is currently no evidence-based treatment for ISSNHL. Breakthroughs in the unequivocal diagnosis and treatment of ISSNHL due to vascular impairment are crucial to improve quality of life. ",Review,Hearing Loss,Japan

Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and cerebral vasospasm (CVS) are delayed products of early brain injury (EBI), which may constitute the principal determinant of an unfavorable patient prognosis. Consequently, the mitigation of DCI and CVS assumes paramount significance in the pursuit of enhanced patient outcomes. However, except for oral nimodipine, there is no effective therapy available in the current guideline. Hence, the exigency arises to proffer novel treatment paradigms. The diversity of hydrogen therapeutic targets has been largely reported in basic research, unveiling its latent capacity to ameliorate EBI in aSAH patients. Methods: Early Hydrogen-Oxygen Gas Mixture Inhalation in Patients with Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (HOMA), a single-center, prospective, open-labeled, randomized controlled clinical trial, endeavors to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydrogen-oxygen gas mixture inhalation therapy in aSAH patients. A cohort of 206 patients will be randomized to either hydrogen-oxygen gas mixture inhalation group (8 h per day, 3 L/min, hydrogen concentration of 67%, oxygen concentration of 33%) or oxygen inhalation group (8 h per day, 3 L/min, oxygen concentration of 33%) within 72 h after aSAH and treated for 7 days in the ICU ward. The primary outcomes are the incidence of DCI and CVS during hospitalization. Discussion: The HOMA aims to evaluate the effectiveness of hydrogen-oxygen gas mixture inhalation therapy in preventing DCI or CVS and improving outcomes in aSAH patients. Notably, this is the first large-scale trial of hydrogen therapy in aSAH patients. Given that the Chinese population represents a significant portion of the global population and the increasing incidence of stroke due to aging, optimizing patient care is vital. Given the current challenges in aSAH patient outcomes, initiating more prospective clinical trials is essential. Recent research has shown hydrogen's therapeutic potential, aligning with EBI in aSAH, driving our exploration of hydrogen therapy's mechanisms in post-aneurysm rupture damage. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol for the HOMA study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University (KY 2022-020-02). All results of the present study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences. ",Study Protocol,Brain Health,China

During ischemia, a profound hypoxic insult develops, resulting in cellular dysfunction and tissue damage. Paradoxically, reperfusion can exacerbate this injury through the generation of reactive oxygen species and the induction of inflammatory cascades. The extensive clinical sequelae of IRI necessitate the development of therapeutic strategies to mitigate its deleterious effects. This has become a cornerstone of ongoing research efforts in both basic and translational science. This review examines the use of molecular hydrogen for IRI in different organs and explores the underlying mechanisms of its action. Molecular hydrogen is a selective antioxidant with anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and signal-modulatory properties. It has been shown to be effective at mitigating IRI in different models, including heart failure, cerebral stroke, transplantation, and surgical interventions.

This review aims to assess the impact of HRW on sports performance and explore the underlying molecular biological mechanisms, with the goal of elucidating how HRW might enhance athletic performance. Methods: This review synthesizes research on HRW by examining articles published between 1980 and April 2024 in databases such as PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Results: It highlights HRW's effects on various aspects of athletic performance, including endurance, strength, sprint times, lunge movements, countermovement jump height, and time to exhaustion. While the precise mechanisms by which HRW affects athletic performance remain unclear, this review investigates its general molecular biological mechanisms beyond the specific context of sports.

At present, most researchers considered that this management measure is helpful for reducing fertilizer consumption and increasing its efficiency, as it can improve nutrient supply of legumestonon-legumes, the spatial nutrient utilization efficiency by enhancing soil spatial heterogeneity, and improve soil structure and disease resistance. However, current theories cannot fully explain the positive effect of crop rotation and inter-cropping systems involving legumes.

Despite of substantial amounts of H2 enriched in the rhizosphere of legumes, only a minor proportion of H2 is found to leak to soil surface. Increasing evidence showed that most H2 released in soil is immediately depleted in the surrounding of N2-fixing nodules by H2-oxidizing bacteria (HOB) thriving in soil. HOB can use H2 as an electron donor to assimilate and fix CO2 through redox reactions to synthesize cellular substances and consequently promote plant growth.

"Russell, Grace",,,Theoretical evaluation of the biological activity of hydrogen ,2025,Medical Gas Research,10.4103/mgr.MEDGASRES-D-24-00083 ,"Hydrogen (H2), the simplest and most ubiquitous molecule in the universe, has garnered significant scientific interest over the past two decades because of its potential as an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Traditionally considered inert, H2 is now being re-evaluated for its unique bioactive properties. H2 selectively neutralizes reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, mitigating oxidative stress without disrupting essential cellular functions. This review therefore aims to provide a theoretical evaluation of the biological activity of H2, focusing on its pharmacokinetics, including absorption, distribution, and retention within biological systems. The pharmacokinetic profile of H2 is crucial for understanding its potential therapeutic applications. The interaction of H2 with protein pockets is of particular interest, as these sites may serve as reservoirs or active sites for H2, influencing its biological activity and retention time. Additionally, the impact of H2 on cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating glucose metabolism and oxidative stress responses, will be explored, offering insights into its potential as a modulator of metabolic and redox homeostasis. Finally, interactions with ferromagnetic molecules within biological environments, as well as effects on cellular signaling mechanisms, add another layer of complexity to the biological role of H2. By synthesizing the current research, this review seeks to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which H2 may exert therapeutic effects while also identifying critical areas for further investigation. Understanding these aspects is essential for fully characterizing the pharmacodynamic profile of H2 and assessing its clinical potential in the treatment of oxidative stress-related disorders.

Serum lipid profiles, including triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), are commonly used clinical biomarkers for monitoring the progression of these metabolic abnormalities. In recent decades, hydrogen-rich water (HRW) has gained attention as a safe and effective treatment, with regulatory effects on lipid peroxidation and inflammatory responses in clinical trials. Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effectiveness of HRW therapy on blood lipid profiles in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for metabolic disorders. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a search for RCT studies was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar databases up to January 2024. Eight studies that met all eligibility criteria, including RCTs involving metabolic dysfunctions and evaluations of lipid profiles, were included for further analysis. Data extraction was followed by quality evaluation using the Jadad scoring system. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA software. Results: The eight selected RCTs included a total of 357 patients with various metabolic disorders. All studies showed either no or low risk of bias. The overall levels of TG [95% CI: -0.27 (-0.47, -0.07)], TC [95% CI: -0.07 (-0.32, -0.18)], and LDL [95% CI: -0.06 (-0.28, 0.15)] demonstrated slight decreases across the studies. However, there was some heterogeneity in HDL levels [95% CI: -0.11 (-0.37, 0.14)] among the studies (I² = 37.32%). Meta-regression analysis further indicated a positive association between the outcomes and the duration of the intervention as a moderating factor. Conclusions: Hydrogen-rich water demonstrated modest lipid-lowering effects in patients with metabolic disorders. However, due to the observed heterogeneity in HDL variations, further long-term trials involving larger populations are needed to clarify these inconsistencies.",Review,Diabetes/Metabolic Disorder,Iran
